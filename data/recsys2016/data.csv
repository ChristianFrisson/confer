This talk takes a fresh look at the practical state of affairs in the context of running a large-scale automated machine learning system that supports 50 Billion decision daily on behalf of hundreds of digital advertisers. Some of the key lessons are 1) robustness beats peak performance almost always, 2) support for the constant dynamic fluctuations in the data stream is essential, 3) models exploiting unknowingly any weakness of your metrics, and finally 4) the fact that despite big data, the data you really want never exists.",,Claudia Perlich,,Automated Machine Learning in the Wild

This dominant, albeit narrow, view of the recommendation problem has been tremendously helpful in advancing research in different ways, e.g., through the establishment of standardized evaluation procedures and metrics. In reality, recommender systems can serve a variety of purposes from the point of view of both consumers and providers. Most of the purposes, however, are significantly underexplored, even though many of them are arguably more aligned with the real-world expectations for recommenders than our current predominant paradigm. Therefore, it is important to revisit our conceptualizations of the potential goals of recommenders and their operationalization as research problems.

In this paper, we propose a novel matrix factorization framework with recursive regularization -- ReMF, which jointly models and learns the influence of hierarchically-organized features on user-item interactions, thus to improve recommendation accuracy. It also provides characterization of how different features in the hierarchy co-influence the modeling of user-item interactions.

For each pair of items, the co-occurrence matrix encodes the number of users that have consumed both items. CoFactor is inspired by the recent success of word embedding models (e.g., word2vec) which can be interpreted as factorizing the word co-occurrence matrix.

By using different item-item models for these user subsets, we can capture differences in their preferences and this can lead to improved performance for top-$N$ recommendations. In this work, we extend SLIM by combining global and local SLIM models. We present a method that computes the prediction scores as a user-specific combination of the predictions derived by a global and local item-item models. We present an approach in which the global model, the local models, their user-specific combination, and the assignment of users to the local models are jointly optimized to improve the top-$N$ recommendation performance.

Each time a machine receives a parameter vector, it averages its current parameter vector with the received one, and continues its iterations from this new point. Additionally, we introduce a similarity based regularization that constrains the user and item factors to be close to the average factors of their similar users and items found on subparts of the distributed user-rating matrix. We analyze the impact of the regularization terms on MovieLens (100K, 1M, 10M) and NetFlix datasets and show that it leads to a more efficient matrix factorization in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and that the asynchronous distributed approach significantly improves in convergence time as compared to an equivalent synchronous distributed approach.",,"Bikash Joshi, Franck Iutzeler, Massih-Reza Amini",,Asynchronous Distributed Matrix Factorization with Similar User and Item Based Regularization

A major limitation of this scenario is that a user might be interested in different things each time when using the system, but there is no way to allow the user to actively alter or adjust the recommended results. To address this issue, we propose the idea of “query-based recommendation” that allows a user to specify his/her search intention while exploring new items, thereby incorporating the concept of information retrieval into recommendation systems. Moreover, the idea is more desirable when the user intention can be expressed in different ways. Take music recommendation as an example: the proposed system allows a user to explore new song tracks by specifying either a track, an album, or an artist. To enable such heterogeneous queries in a recommender system, we present a novel technique called “Heterogeneous Preference Embedding” to encode user preference and query intention into low-dimensional vector spaces. Then, with simple search methods or similarity calculations, we can use the encoded representation of queries to generate recommendations. This method is fairly flexible and it is easy to add other types of information when available. Evaluations on three music listening datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art matrix factorization and network embedding methods.",,"Chih-Ming Chen, Ming-Feng Tsai, Yu-Ching Lin, Yi-Hsuan Yang",,Query-based Music Recommendations via Preference Embedding

Specifically, in this paper we aim at achieving a more comprehensive and accurate user modeling by modeling user’s actions in multiple aligned heterogeneous sites simultaneously. To do so, we propose a modularized probabilistic graphical model framework JUMA. We further integrate topic model and matrix factorization into JUMA for joint user modeling over text-based and item-based sites. We assemble and publish large-scale dataset for comprehensive analyzing and evaluation. Experimental results show that our framework JUMA out performs traditional within-site user modeling techniques, especially for cold-start scenarios. For cold-start users, we achieve relative improvements of 9.3% and 12.8% comparing to existing within-site approaches for recommendation in item-based and text-based sites respectively.

In order to resolve this problem we propose to treat user feedback as a categorical variable and model it with users and items in a ternary way. We employ a third-order tensor factorization technique and implement a higher order folding-in method to support online recommendations. The method is equally sensitive to entire spectrum of user ratings and is able to accurately predict relevant items even from a negative only feedback. Our method may partially eliminate the need for complicated rating elicitation process as it provides means for personalized recommendations from the very beginning of an interaction with a recommender system. We also propose a modification of standard metrics which helps to reveal unwanted biases and account for sensitivity to a negative feedback.

A unique characteristic of the algorithm is that it learns and updates the mapping between the audio feature space and the item latent space each time during the iterations of the factorization process. This way, the content features can be better exploited in forming the latent features for both users and items, leading to more effective solutions for cold-start recommendation.

Unlike the great variety of supervised machine learning algorithms which traditionally rely on expert input labels and are typically used for decision making by an expert, recommender systems specifically rely on data input from non-expert or casual users and are meant to be used directly by these same non-expert users on an every day basis. Furthermore, the advances in online machine learning, data generation, and predictive model learning have become increasingly interdependent, such that each one feeds on the other in an iterative cycle. Research in psychology suggests that people's choices are (1) contextually dependent, and (2) dependent on interaction history. Thus, while standard methods of training and assessing performance of recommender systems rely on benchmark datasets, we suggest that a critical step in the evolution of recommender systems is the development of benchmark {\em models} of human behavior that capture contextual and dynamic aspects of human behavior. It is important to emphasize that even extensive real life user-tests may not be sufficient to make up for this gap in benchmarking validity because user tests are typically done with either a focus on user satisfaction or engagement (clicks, sales, likes, etc) with whatever the recommender algorithm suggests to the user, and thus ignore the human cognitive aspect. We conclude by highlighting the interdisciplinary implications of this endeavor.",,"Patrick Shafto, Olfa Nasraoui",,Human-Recommender Systems: From Benchmark Data to Benchmark Cognitive Models

It seems obvious that these eye gaze patterns contain a rich signal concerning these users' preferences. However, because eye tracking data is not available to most recommender systems, these signals are not widely incorporated into personalization models. In this work, we show that it is possible to predict gaze by combining easily-collected user browsing data with eye tracking data from a small number of users in a grid-based recommender interface. Our technique is able to leverage a small amount of eye tracking data to infer gaze patterns for other users. We evaluate our prediction models in MovieLens -- an online movie recommender system. Our results show that incorporating eye tracking data from a small number of users significantly boosts accuracy as compared with only using browsing data, even though the eye-tracked users are different from the testing users (e.g. AUC=0.823 vs. 0.693 in predicting whether a user will fixate on an item). We also demonstrate that Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) can be applied in this setting; they are better than linear models in predicting fixation probability and capturing the interface regularity through Bayesian inference (AUC=0.823 vs. 0.757).",,"Qian Zhao, Shuo Chang, F.

As a result, despite good reasons to believe personality assessments should be useful in recommenders, we are left with no substantial demonstrated impact. In this work, we start with user data from a live recommender system, but study category-by-category variations in preference (both rating levels and distribution) across different personality types. By doing this, we hope to isolate specific areas where personality is most likely to provide value in recommender systems, while also modeling an analytic process that can be used in other domains. After controlling for the family-wise error rate, we find that High Agreeableness users rate at least 0.5 stars higher on a 5-star scale compared to low Agreeableness users.

We propose using the exponential learning curve model to study how conversion rates change with the number of reviews. We call the difference in conversion rate between having no reviews and an infinite number the value of reviews. We find that, on average, the conversion rate of a product can increase by as much as 270% as it accumulates reviews, amongst the users that choose to display them. We also find diminishing marginal value as a product accumu- lates reviews, with the first five reviews driving the bulk of the aforementioned increase. To address the problem of si- multaneity of increase of reviews and conversion rate, we use customer sessions in which reviews were not displayed as a control for trends that would have happened regardless of the increase in the review volume. Using our framework, we further find that high priced items have a higher value for reviews than lower priced items. High priced items can see their conversion rate increase by as much as 380% as they accumulate reviews compared to 190% for low priced items.We infer that the existence of reviews provides valu- able signals to the customers, increasing their propensity to purchase. We also infer that users usually don’t pay atten- tion to the entire set of reviews, especially if there are a lot of them, but instead they focus on the first few available.

Social sensing has become an emerging application paradigm that uses humans as sensors to observe and report events in the physical world. These human sensed observations are often viewed as binary claims (either true or false). A fundamental challenge in social sensing is how to ascertain the credibility of claims and the reliability of sources without knowing either of them a priori. We refer to this challenge as truth discovery. While prior works have made progress on addressing this challenge, an important limitation exists: they did not explore the mood sensitivity aspect of the problem. Therefore, the claims identified as correct by current solutions can be completely biased in regards to the mood of human sources and lead to useless or even misleading recommendations. In this paper, we present a new analytical model that explicitly considers the mood sensitivity feature in the solution of truth discovery problem. The new model solves a multi-dimensional estimation problem to jointly estimate the correctness and mood neutrality of claims as well as the reliability and mood sensitivity of sources. We compare our model with state-of-the-art truth discovery solutions using four real world datasets collected from Twitter during recent disastrous and emergent events: Brussels Bombing, Paris Attack, Oregon Shooting, Baltimore Riots, which occurred in 2015 and 2016.

Existing approaches for dealing with NMAR data, such as Response-aware and context-aware matrix factorization, do not model NMAR data in terms of the user and item features and are not designed with the characteristics of grade data in mind. In this work we investigate how the student and course academic features influence the enrollment patterns and we use these features to define student and course groups at various levels of granularity.

In particular, when rating data is sparse, document modeling-based approaches have improved the accuracy by additionally utilizing textual data such as reviews, abstracts, or synopses. However, due to the inherent limitation of the bag-of-words model, they have difficulties in effectively utilizing contextual information of the documents, which leads to shallow understanding of the documents.

The recommendation process is based only on user activity within a single session, defined as a sequence of events. This information is incorporated in the recommendation process by explicit context modeling with factorization methods and a novel approach with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Compared to the session modeling approach, RNN directly models the dependency of user observed sequential behavior throughout its recurrent structure. The evaluation discusses the results based on sessions from real-life system with ephemeral items (identified only by the set of their attributes) for the task of top-n best recommendations.",,Bartłomiej Twardowski,,Modelling Contextual Information in Session-Aware Recommender Systems with Neural Networks

Our study is based on a real-world deployment of an in-store recommendation system in the brick-and-mortar grocery industry. We base our analysis on transaction data of more than 100,000 unique users and more than four million product recommendations. Our findings suggest that the success of a recommendation significantly depends on the inter-purchase time within the respective category. Different sensitivities across product categories further stress the importance of timing and its interplay with category characteristics within the context of recommender systems.

In addition to data scale, these networks can be heterogeneous and contain complex structures between different users, between social entities and various interactions between users and social entities. This is especially true in enterprise social networks where hierarchies explicitly exist between employees as well. In such networks, producing the best recommendations for each user is a very challenging problem for two main reasons. First, the complex structures in the social network need to be properly mined and exploited by the algorithm. Second, these networks contain millions or even billions of edges making the problem very difficult computationally. In this paper we present Guided Walk, a supervised graph based algorithm that learns the significance of different network links for each user and then produces entity recommendations based on this learning phase. We compare the algorithm with a set of baseline algorithms using offline evaluation techniques as well as a user survey. The offline results show that the algorithm outperforms the next best algorithm by a factor of 3.6. The user survey further confirms that the recommendation are not only relevant but also rank high in terms of personal relevance for each user. To deal with large scale social networks, the Guided Walk algorithm is formulated as a Pregel program which allows us to utilize the power of distributed parallel computing. This would allow horizontally scaling the algorithm for larger social networks by simply adding more compute nodes to the cluster.",,"Roy Levin, Hassan Abassi, Uzi Cohen",,Guided Walk: A Scalable Recommendation Algorithm for Complex Heterogeneous Social Networks

An appropriate trust inference mechanism is necessary in extending the knowledge base of trust opinions and tackling the issue of limited trust information due to connection sparsity of social networks. In this work, we offer a new solution to trust inference in social networks to provide a better knowledge base for trust-aware recommender systems. We propose using a semiring framework as a nonlinear way to combine trust evidences for inferring trust, where trust relationship is model as 2-D vector containing both trust and certainty information. The trust propagation and aggregation rules, as the building blocks of our trust inference scheme, are based upon the properties of trust relationships. In our approach, both trust and distrust (i.e., positive and negative trust) are considered, and opinion conflict resolution is supported. We evaluate the proposed approach on real-world datasets, and show that our trust inference framework has high accuracy, and is capable of handling trust relationship in large networks.

In this paper, we investigate three methods for making KG based recommendations using a general-purpose probabilistic logic system called ProPPR. The simplest of the models, EntitySim, uses only the links of the graph. We then extend the model to TypeSim that also uses the types of the entities to boost its generalization capabilities. Next, we develop a graph based latent factor model, GraphLF, which combines the strengths of latent factorization with graphs. We compare our approaches to a recently proposed state-of-the-art graph recommendation method on two large datasets, Yelp and MovieLens-100K.

We propose a novel strategy to address the above problem in a principled manner. The key insight is that as we observe a user's interactions, it reveals much more information about her desires. We exploit this by inferring the within-session user intent \emph{on-the-fly} based on navigation interactions, since they offer valuable clues into a user's current state of mind. Using navigation patterns and adapting recommendations in real-time creates an opportunity to provide more accurate recommendations. By prefetching a larger amount of content, this can be carried out entirely in the client (such as a browser) without added latency.

They have recently proved to be appealing models for a number of machine learning tasks, including product recommendation. DPPs are parametrized by a positive semi-definite kernel matrix. Prior work has shown that using a low-rank factorization of this kernel provides scalability improvements that open the door to training on large-scale datasets and computing online recommendations, both of which are infeasible with standard DPP models that use a full-rank kernel. A low-rank DPP model can be trained using an optimization-based method, such as stochastic gradient ascent, to find a point estimate of the kernel parameters, which can be performed efficiently on large-scale datasets. However, this approach requires careful tuning of regularization parameters to prevent overfitting and provide good predictive performance, which can be computationally expensive. In this paper we present a Bayesian method for learning a low-rank factorization of this kernel, which provides automatic control of regularization. We show that our Bayesian low-rank DPP model can be trained efficiently using stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC).

We build on the insight that different kinds of feedback, e.g., a click versus a like, reflect different levels of commitment or preference. Our approach differs from previous work in that it exploits multiple sources of feedback simultaneously during the training process. The novelty of MF-BPR is an extended sampling method that equates feedback sources with ``levels'' that reflect the expected contribution of the signal.

At such a scale it is very important to recommend relevant information for a good user experience. Recommendations in the News and Media domain bring a unique set of challenges due to the dynamic nature of the data as well as unique consumption patterns. The biggest challenge with building recommendation systems in the News domain is the dynamic nature of the domain itself; new content is published every few minutes and majority of the content has a short shelf life, i.e., the news is not relevant to users after a certain time span and the time span is generally of the order of hours rather than days, making it important to deliver relevant content in a timely manner. Moreover, our users consume content differently based on time of day. For example, some users whose focus is market news and market data during the day consume more long form and generic articles and videos in the evening. User preferences, along with being cyclical in nature, tend to change over time, so algorithms need to adapt to the changing taste of the user.

In this talk, we will highlight the four most interesting challenges we encountered in making our algorithms operate globally and how this improved our ability to connect members worldwide with stories they'll love. In particular, we will dive into the problems of uneven availability across catalogs, balancing personal and cultural tastes, handling language, and tracking quality of recommendations. Uneven catalog availability is a challenge because many recommendation algorithms assume that people could interact with any item and then use the absence of interaction implicitly or explicitly as negative information in the model. However, this assumption does not hold globally and across time where item availability differs. Running algorithms globally means needing a notion of location so that we can handle local variations in taste while also providing a good basis for personalization. Language is another challenge in recommending video content because people can typically only enjoy content that has assets (audio, subtitles) in languages they understand. The preferences for how people enjoy such content also vary between people and depend on their familiarity with a language. Also, while would like our recommendations to work well for every one of our members, tracking quality becomes difficult because with so many members in so many countries speaking so many languages, it can be hard to determine when an algorithm or system is performing sub-optimally for some subset of them.

Pandora radio is best known for the Music Genome Project; the most unique and richly labeled music catalog of 1.5 million+ tracks. While this content-based approach to music recommendation is extremely effective and still used today as the foundation to the leading online radio service, Pandora has also collected more than a decade of contextual listener feedback in the form of more than 65 billion thumbs from 79M+ monthly active users who have created more than 9 billion stations.

However, there remains a large gap between deploying the core algorithm provided by these systems and delivering an application-quality recommendation system, specifically tailored to address complex and dynamically changing business needs. We will present a real-time recommendation engine built on our graph data platform that provides the following extensions to a basic recommendation model: \begin{enumerate} \item {\bf True real-time recommendation algorithms}: We provide a simple framework for customers to author and deploy real-time recommendation algorithms with no pre-computation required. \item {\bf Streaming updates of user behavior and product information}: As quickly as data are generated, the recommendation engine applies the updates and can serve updated results. \item {\bf Support for offline recommendation algorithms}: Users with existing investment in a quality recommendation program can import their pre-computed results into the graph database for efficient, unified service of results. \item {\bf Tools for Business-centric requirements}: The engine offers a range of weighting, sorting, and filtering options to tailor recommendation algorithms to business needs. For example, the engine can eliminate products that are out of stock or favor products that are known to perform well in different real-time contexts. \item {\bf Multiple algorithm ensemble support}: There is rarely a case where one algorithm is sufficient to identify the best items to recommend to a user. Integrating points 1 through 4, the engine provides intuitive methods for specifying and combining the results of multiple recommendation algorithms to achieve the highest-performing results. \item {\bf Recommendation feedback tools}: Pre- and Post-analysis tools, built around a business' logic, are used to generate reports to assess the value of both potential and currently deployed algorithms. \end{enumerate} Of particular interest to RecSys attendees, we will discuss the technical aspects of a graph-based implementation of the recommendation engine and how it facilitates the rapid design and deployment of an efficient real-time recommendation system under a single service. We will briefly discuss the architecture of our graph database system to show how it can efficiently serve a large user base even from a single server shared-memory architecture. Attendees will also learn about graph-based data modeling and how viewing data from this perspective can lead to new types of business insights and applications that are not easily implemented using traditional relational and/or NoSQL platforms.

d6,demo,T-RecS: A Framework for a Temporal Semantic Analysis of the ACM Recommender Systems Conference,"Fedelucio Narducci, Pierpaolo Basile, Pasquale Lops, Marco De Gemmis, Giovanni Semeraro",Demo Reception,,Morss Hall,09-17-16,18:00:00,22:00:00,,,"This paper presents T-RecS (Temporal analysis of Recommender Systems conference proceedings), a framework that supplies services to analyze the Recommender Systems Conference proceedings from the first edition, held in 2007, to the last one, held in 2015, under a temporal point of view.
The idea behind T-RecS is to identify linguistic phenomena that reflect some interesting variations for the research community, such as topic drift, or how the correlation between two terms changed over time, or how similarity between two authors evolved over time. The implemented framework can be easily adapted for the analysis of different corpora and domains.",,,,
t1,tutorial,People Recommendation,"Ido Guy, Luiz Pizzato",Tutorial: People Recommendation,,Room 202,09-17-16,14:00:00,15:40:00,,,"People recommenders, which recommend people to themselves, have become a rich research area within the broad recommender systems community. From “people you may know” and “who to follow” widgets, through people introduction at conferences, job recommendations and job-candidate search, to dating partner matchmakers, people recommendations proliferate.

This tutorial will present an overview of the people recommender systems domain. We will present the different types and use cases of people recommendations, the special techniques used to recommend people to themselves, key research work, and open challenges.",,,,
t2,tutorial,Lessons Learned from Building Real­-Life Recommender Systems,"Xavier Amatriain, Deepak Agarwal",Tutorial: Lessons Learned from Building Real­-Life Recommender Systems,,Room 202,09-18-16,16:20:00,18:00:00,,,"In 2006, Netflix announced a $1M prize competition to advance recommendation algorithms. The recommendation problem was simplified as the accuracy in predicting a user rating measured by the Root Mean Squared Error. While that formulation helped get the attention of the research community, it put the focus on the wrong approach and metric while leaving many important factors out.

In this talk we will talk we will describe the advances in Recommender Systems in the last 10 years from an industry perspective based on the instructors’ personal experience at companies like Quora, LinkedIn, Netflix, or Yahoo!. We will do so in the form of different lessons learned through the years. Some of those lessons will describe the different components of modern recommender systems such as: personalized ranking, similarity, explanations, context ­awareness, or multi­armed bandits. Others will also review the usage of novel algorithmic approaches such as Factorization Machines, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, SimRank, Deep Neural Networks, or List-wise learning ­to ­rank. Others will dive into details of the importance of gathering the right data or using the correct optimization metric.

But, most importantly, we will give many examples of prototypical industrial­ scale recommender systems with special focus on those unsolved challenges that should define the future of the recommender systems area.",,,,
t3,tutorial,Matrix and Tensor Decomposition in Recommender Systems,Panagiotis Symeonidis,Tutorial: Matrix and Tensor Decomposition in Recommender Systems,,Student Center 307,09-19-16,8:30:00,10:10:00,,,"The tutorial will offer a rich blend of theory and practice regarding dimensionality reduction methods, to address the information overload problem in recommender systems. This problem affects our everyday experience while searching for knowledge on a topic. Naive Collaborative Filtering cannot deal with challenging issues such as scalability, noise, and sparsity. We can deal with all the aforementioned challenges by applying matrix and tensor decomposition methods (also known as factorization methods). These methods have been proven to be the most accurate (i.e., Netflix prize) and efficient for handling big data. For each method (SVD, SVD++, timeSVD++, HOSVD, CUR, etc.) we will provide a detailed theoretical mathematical background and a step-by-step analysis, by using an integrated toy example, which runs throughout all parts of the tutorial, and helps the audience to understand clearly the differences among different factorization methods.

Each part of this tutorial provides the audience with an introduction to the most important aspects of Matrix and Tensor Factorization techniques in Recommender Systems and also contains many valuable references to relevant research papers. It also provides researchers and developers a comprehensive overview of the general concepts and techniques (e.g., models and algorithms) related with Matrix and Tensor Factorization recommendation and present them all new methods through real-life application scenarios and toy examples.",,,,

The goal of this tutorial is to provide the RecSys audience with an overview on group recommendation. We will first formally introduce the problem of producing recommendations to groups, then present a survey based on the tasks performed by these systems. We will also analyze challenging topics like their evaluation, and present emerging aspects and techniques in this area. The tutorial will end with a summary that highlights open issues and research challenges.",,,,
