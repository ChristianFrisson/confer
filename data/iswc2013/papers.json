In this paper, we present scalable algorithms to \ufb01nd the top-K answers to a practically important subset of SPARQL-queries, denoted as importance queries, via a suite of pruning techniques. We test our algorithms on multiple real-world graph data sets, showing that our algorithms are e\ufb03cient even on networks with up to 6M vertices and 15M edges and far more e\ufb03cient than popular triple stores.",

In particular, we will show how a typical experience of a user editing a large ontology can be improved if the reasoner (or ontology IDE) provides the capability of instantaneously re-classifying the ontology in the background mode when a change is made. In addition, we intend to demonstrate how incremental reasoning helps in other tasks such as answering DL queries and computing explanations of entailments. We will use our OWL EL reasoner ELK and its Protege plug-in as the main tools to highlight these benefits.",

    "abstract": "Museums around the world have built databases with meta-data about millions of objects, their history, the people who created them, and the entities they represent. This data is stored in proprietary databases and is not readily available for use. Recently, museums embraced the Semantic Web as a means to make this data available to the world, but the experience so far shows that publishing museum data to the linked data cloud is difficult: the databases are large and complex, the information is richly structured and varies from museum to museum, and it is difficult to link the data to other datasets. We have been collaborating with the Smithsonian American Art Museum to create a set of tools that allow museums and other cultural heritage institutions to publish their data as Linked Open Data. In this demonstration we will show the end-to-end process of starting with the original source data, modeling the data with respect to a ontology of cultural heritage data, linking the data to DBpedia, and then publishing the information as Linked Open Data.

However, most data annotation frameworks do not translate well to semantic web. We present the grounded annotation framework (GAF), a two-layered framework that aims to build a bridge between mentions of events in a data source such as a text document and their formal representation as instance}. By choosing a two-layered approach, neither the mention layer, nor the semantic layer needs to compromise on what can be represented. We demonstrate the strengths of GAF in flexibility and reasoning through a use case on earthquakes in Southeast Asia.",

    "track": "Poster/Demo Paper", 
    "abstract": "The Web of Data (WoD) continues to grow steadily each year. At over 31 billion triples in 2011, querying this globally distributed data space poses several scalability challenges. One critical aspect when processing distributed SPARQL queries is given by the number and type of distributed joins needed. Traditionally, query optimizers alleviate this issue by attempting to find an optimal query plan assuming a given and fixed data distribution. Discarding this fixed data partitioning assumption, offers the opportunity to create a data distribution that minimizes the number of distributed joins. Recent research focused on data- and query-driven partitioning strategies for both RDF and relational data. In this paper we propose a novel and naive workload-driven approach to data partitioning and investigate the impact of various critical factors on the number of resulting distributed joins. In a preliminary experiment we empirically compare our method to traditional partitioning strategies using a DBpedia query log of 400\u2019000 queries and observe that it can produce up to 50% less distributed joins than an expert (manual) partitioning scheme, 45% less than partitioning based on hashing by subject and up to 83% less distributed joins than just random assignment.",

To ensure scalability most distributed systems partition the data and distribute the workload among multiple machines. This approach does, however, raise the question how the data and the workload should be partitioned and distributed. A uniform scheduling strategy---a uniform distribution of computation load among available machines---typically used by stream processing systems, disregards network-load as one of the major bottlenecks for throughput resulting in an immense load in terms of inter-machine communication. We propose a graph-partitioning based approach for workload scheduling within stream processing systems.We implemented a distributed triple-stream processing engine on top of the Storm realtime computation framework and evaluate its communication behavior using two real-world datasets. We show that the application of graph partitioning algorithms can decrease inter-machine communication substantially (by 40% to 99%) whilst maintaining an even workload distribution, even using very limited data statistics. We also find that processing RDF data as single triples at a time rather than graph fragments (containing multiple triples), may decrease throughput indicating the usefulness of semantics.",

In this paper we present IncMap, a system that supports a semiautomatic approach for matching relational schemata and ontologies. Our approach is based on a novel matching technique that represents the schematic elements of an ontology and a relational schema in a unified way.

    "abstract": "This study proposes a novel method with which Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) resources on the Web can be effectively matched and connected. The three countries share Chinese characters even though Japan and Korea have their own language. Utilizing the Unihan database, which covers more than 45,000 characters commonly used by the three countries, we show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional method based on string matching in finding similar characters and words used in these countries. The results represent a first step towards overcoming the multilingual barrier in semantically interlinking Asian LOD resources.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a work in progress that explores the applicability of ontology for providing solutions in medical domain. We investigate whether it is feasible to use ontologies and ontology-based data access to automate one of common clinical tasks that are constantly faced by general practitioners but labor intensive and error prone in term of relevant information retrieved from electronic health records. The focus of our study is on improving diabetes patient selection for clinical trials or medical research. The biggest impediment to automating such clinical tasks is the essential requirement of bridging the semantic gaps between existing patient data from electronic health records, such as reasons for visit, chronic conditions and diagnoses from practice notes, pathology tests and prescriptions stored in general practice information systems, and the ways which researchers or general practitioners interpret those records. Our current comprehension is that automation of identifying diabetes patients for clinical or research purposes can be specified systematically as a solution supported by semantic retrieval. We detail the challenges to build a realistic case study, which consists of solving issues related to conceptualization of data and domain context, integration of different datasets, ontology creation based on SNOMED CT-AU\u00ae standard, mapping between existing data and ontology, and dilemma of data fitness for research use. Our prototype is based on data which scale to thirteen years of approximate 100,000 anonymous patient records from four general practices in south western Sydney.",

In this demo, we present a novel R2RML mapping editor, which provides a user interface to create and edit mappings interactively.  Hiding the R2RML vocabulary intricacies from the user, the editor enables even  non-experts to create R2RML mappings in a guided way, offers immediate feedback by means of integrated preview functionality, and covers all the major language constructs defined in the R2RML standard.",

The successful application of ontology matching techniques is strongly tied to an e\ufb00ective exploration of the complex and diverse biomedical terminology contained in biomedical ontologies. In this paper, we present an overview of the lexical components of several biomedical ontologies and investigate how di\ufb00erent approaches for their use can impact the performance of ontology matching techniques. We propose novel approaches for exploring the di\ufb00erent types of synonyms encoded by the ontologies and for extending them based both on internal synonym derivation and on external ontologies. We evaluate our approaches using AgreementMaker, a successful ontology matching platform that implements several lexical matchers, and apply them to a set of four benchmark biomedical ontology matching tasks. Our results demonstrate the impact that an adequate consideration of ontology synonyms can have on matching performance, and validate our novel approach for combining internal and external synonym sources as a competitive and in many cases improved solution for biomedical ontology matching.",

    "track": "Research Track Paper", 
    "abstract": "DBpedia is a large-scale knowledge base that exploits Wikipedia as primary data source. The extraction procedure requires to manually map Wikipedia infoboxes into the DBpedia ontology. Thanks to crowdsourcing, a large number of infoboxes has been mapped in the English DBpedia. Consequently, the same procedure has been applied to other languages to create the localized versions of DBpedia. However, the number of accomplished mappings is still small and limited to most frequent infoboxes. Furthermore, mappings need maintenance due to the constant and quick changes of Wikipedia articles. In this paper, we focus on the problem of automatically mapping infobox attributes to properties into the DBpedia ontology for extending the coverage of the existing localized versions or building from scratch versions for languages not covered in the current version. The evaluation has been performed on the Italian mappings. We compared our results with the current mappings on a random sample re-annotated by the authors. We report results comparable to the ones obtained by a human annotator in term of precision, but our approach leads to a signi\ufb01cant improvement in recall and speed. Speci\ufb01cally, we mapped 45,978 Wikipedia infobox attributes to DBpedia properties in 14 different languages for which mappings were not yet available. The resource is made available in an open format.",

In this article, we propose a semi-automatic schemata construction approach addressing this problem: First, the frequency of axiom patterns in existing knowledge bases is discovered. Afterwards, those patterns are converted to SPARQL based pattern detection algorithms, which allow to enrich knowledge base schemata. We argue that we present the \ufb01rst scalable knowledge base enrichment approach based on real schema usage patterns.

The contextual tag cloud system is a novel application that helps users explore a large scale RDF dataset: the tags are ontological terms (classes and properties), the context is a set of tags that de\ufb01nes a subset of instances, and the font sizes re\ufb02ect the number of instances that use each tag. It visualizes the patterns of instances speci\ufb01ed by the context a user constructs. Given a request with a speci\ufb01c context, the system needs to quickly \ufb01nd what other tags the instances in the context use, and how many instances in the context use each tag. The key question we answer in this paper is how to scale to Linked Data; in particular we use a dataset with 1.4 billion triples and over 380,000 tags. This is complicated by the fact that the calculation should, when directed by the user, consider the entailment of taxonomic and/or domain/range axioms in the ontology. We combine a scalable preprocessing approach with a specially-constructed inverted index and use three approaches to prune unnecessary counts for faster intersection computations. We compare our system with a state-of-the-art triple store, examine how pruning rules interact with inference and analyze our design choices.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of links between resources within knowledge bases is of crucial importance to realize the vision of the Semantic Web. Addressing this task is especially challenging when dealing with geo-spatial datasets due to their sheer size and the potential complexity of single geo-spatial objects. Yet, so far, little attention has been paid to the characteristics of geo-spatial data within the context of link discovery. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting Orchid, a reduction-ratio-optimal link discovery approach designed especially for geo-spatial data. Orchid relies on a combination of the Hausdor\ufb00 and orthodromic metrics to compute the distance between geo-spatial objects. We \ufb01rst present two novel approaches for the e\ufb03cient computation of Hausdor\ufb00 distances. Then, we present the space tiling approach implemented by Orchid and prove that it is optimal with respect to the reduction ratio that it can achieve. The evaluation of our approaches is carried out on three real datasets of di\ufb00erent size and complexity. Our results suggest that our approaches to the computation of Hausdor\ufb00 distances require two orders of magnitude less orthodromic distances computations to compare geographical data. Moreover, they require two orders of magnitude less time than a naive approach to achieve this goal. Finally, our results indicate that Orchid scales to large datasets while outperforming the state of the art signi\ufb01cantly.",

A common problem is the imprecision in the use of vocabularies: annotators can misunderstand the semantics of a class or property or may not be able to \ufb01nd the right objects to annotate with. This decreases the quality of data and may eventually hamper its usability over large scale. This paper describes Statistical Knowledge Patterns (SKP) as a means to address this issue. SKPs encapsulate key information about ontology classes, including synonymous properties in (and across) datasets, and are automatically generated based on statistical data analysis. SKPs can be e\ufb00ectively used to automatically normalise data, and hence increase recall in querying. Both pattern extraction and pattern usage are completely automated. The main bene\ufb01ts of SKPs are that: (1) their structure allows for both accurate query expansion and restriction; (2) they are context dependent, hence they describe the usage and meaning of properties in the context of a particular class; and (3) they can be generated o\ufb04ine, hence the equivalence among relations can be used e\ufb03ciently at run time.",

This type of automated knowledge building requires a decent level of precision, which is hard to achieve with automatically acquired rule sets learned from unlabeled data by means of distant or minimal supervision. This paper shows how precision of relation extraction can be considerably improved by employing a wide-coverage, general-purpose lexical semantic network, i.e., BabelNet, for effective semantic rule \ufb01ltering. We apply Word Sense Disambiguation to the content words of the automatically extracted rules. As a result a set of relation-speci\ufb01c relevant concepts is obtained, and each of these concepts is then used to represent the structured semantics of the corresponding relation. The resulting relation-speci\ufb01c subgraphs of BabelNet are used as semantic \ufb01lters for estimating the adequacy of the extracted rules. For the seven semantic relations tested here, the semantic \ufb01lter consistently yields a higher precision at any relative recall value in the high-recall range.",

Often, the user\u2019s initial interest can be uniquely linked to an entity in a knowledge base. In this case, it is natural to recommend the explicitly linked entities for further exploration. In real world knowledge bases, however, the number of linked entities may be very large and not all related entities may be equally relevant. Thus, there is a need for ranking related entities. In this paper, we describe Spark, a recommendation engine that links a user\u2019s initial query to an entity within a knowledge base and provides a ranking of the related entities. Spark extracts several signals from a variety of data sources, including Yahoo! Web Search, Twitter, and Flickr, using a large cluster of computers running Hadoop. These signals are combined with a machine learned ranking model in order to produce a \ufb01nal recommendation of entities to user queries. This system is currently powering Yahoo! Web Search result pages.",

Up until now RDF data publishers have focused on exposing and linking public data. With the advent of SPARQL 1.1, the linked data infrastructure can be used, not only as a means of publishing open data but also, as a general mechanism for managing distributed graph data. However, such a decentralised architecture brings with it a number of additional challenges with respect to both data security and integrity. In this paper, we propose a general authorisation framework that can be used to deliver dynamic query results based on user credentials and to cater for the secure manipulation of linked data. Speci\ufb01cally we describe how graph patterns, propagation rules, con\ufb02ict resolution policies and integrity constraints can together be used to specify and enforce consistent access control policies.",

Initiatives for the publication and interlinking of government service catalogs as Linked Open Data (lod) support the interoperability among European administrations and improve the capability of foreign citizens to access services across Europe. However, linking service catalogs to reference lod catalogs requires a signi\ufb01cant e\ufb00ort from local administrations, preventing the uptake of interoperable solutions at a large scale. The web application presented in this paper is named CroSeR (Cross-language Service Retriever) and supports public bodies in the process of linking their own service catalogs to the lod cloud. CroSeR supports di\ufb00erent European languages and adopts a semantic representation of e-gov services based on Wikipedia. CroSeR tries to overcome problems related to the short textual descriptions associated to a service by embodying a semantic annotation algorithm that enriches service labels with emerging Wikipedia concepts related to the service. An experimental evaluation carried-out on e-gov service catalogs in \ufb01ve di\ufb00erent languages shows the e\ufb00ectiveness of our model.",

The mapping algorithm decomposes the query into a set of paths, and compares the set of paths with a similar decomposition of a source ontology. Using test sets from three real world applications, QODI achieves favorable results compared with AgreementMaker, a leading ontology matcher, and an ontology-based implementation of the mapping methods detailed for Clio, the state-of-the-art relational data integration and data exchange system.",

    "abstract": "Semantic Web ontologies are fast-growing knowledge sources on the Web. Searching relevant concepts from this large repository is a challenging problem. The current Semantic Web search engines provide either (1) coarse-grained search over ontologies or (2) very fine-grained search over individuals. We believe searching and ranking concepts across ontologies provides an ideal granularity for certain tasks such as ontology population and web page annotation. Towards this objective, we propose a novel approach of indexing concepts using ontology axioms in an inverted file structure and ranking them using a dynamic ranking algorithm. Our proposed method is generic and domain-independent. A preliminary evaluation indicates that our proposed method is effective, outperforming the search function of BioPortal, a large and widely-used ontology repository.",

The obtained patterns require an interpretation that is usually achieved using some background knowledge given by experts from several domains. On the other hand, the rise of Linked Data has increased the number of con- nected cross-disciplinary knowledge, in the form of RDF datasets, classes and relationships. Here we show how Linked Data can be used in an Inductive Logic Programming process, where they provide background knowledge for finding hypotheses regarding the unrevealed connections between items of a cluster. By using an example with clusters of books, we show how different Linked Data sources can be used to automatically generate rules giving an underlying explanation to such clusters.",

    "track": "Semantic Web In Use Track Paper", 
    "abstract": "Europe has a high impact on the global biomedical literature, having contributed with a growing number of research articles and a signi\ufb01cant citation impact. However, the impact of research and development generated by European countries on economic, educational and healthcare performance is poorly understood. The recent Linking Open Data (LOD) project has made a lot of data sources publicly available and in human-readable formats. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of LOD in assessing the impact of Research and Development (R&D) on the economic, education and healthcare performance in Europe. We extract relevant variables from two LOD datasets, namely World Bank and Eurostat. We analyze the data for 20 out of the 27 European countries over a span of 10 years (1999 to 2009). We use a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach to quantify the impact of R&D on the different measures. We perform different exploratory and con\ufb01rmatory factorial analysis evaluations which gives rise to four latent variables that are included in the model: (i) Research and Development (R&D), (ii) Economic Performance (EcoP), (iii) Educational Performance (EduP), (iv) Healthcare performance (HcareP) of the European countries. Our results indicate the importance of R&D to the overall development of the European educational and healthcare performance (directly) and economic performance (indirectly). The results also shows the practical applicability of LOD to estimate this impact.",

    "title": "Semantic Data and Models Sharing in systems Biology: The Just Enough Results Model and the SEEK Platform", 
    "track": "Semantic Web In Use Track Paper", 
    "abstract": "Research in Systems Biology involves integrating data and knowledge about the dynamic processes in biological systems in order to understand and model them. Semantic web technologies should be ideal for exploring the complex networks of genes, proteins and metabolites that interact, but much of this data is not natively available to the semantic web. Data is typically collected and stored with free-text annotations in spreadsheets, many of which do not conform to existing metadata standards and are often not publica lly released. Along with initiatives to promote more data sharing, one of the main challenges is therefore to semantically annotate and extract this data so that it is available to the research community. Data annotation and curation are expensive and undervalued tasks that have enormous benefits to the discipline as a whole, but fewer benefits to the individual data producers. By embedding semantic annotation into spreadsheets, however, and automat ically extracting this data into RDF at the time of repository submission, the process of producing standards-compliant data, that is available for semantic web querying, can be achieved without adding additional overheads to laboratory data management. This paper describes these strategies in the context of semantic data management in the SEEK. The SEEK is a web-based resource for sharing and exchanging Systems Biology data and models that is underpinned by the JERM ontology (Just Enough Results Model), which describes the relationships between data, models, protocols and experiments. The SEEK was originally developed for SysMO, a large European Systems Biology consortium studying micro-organisms, but it has since had widespread adoption across European Systems Biology.",

This makes the discovery of content within these parts of the archive very di\ufb03cult. In this paper we describe a system based on Semantic Web technologies which helps us to quickly locate content related to current news events within those parts of the BBC\u2019s archive with little or no pre-existing metadata. This system is driven by automated interlinking of archive content with the Semantic Web, user validations of the resulting data and topic extraction from live BBC News subtitles. The resulting inter-links between live news subtitles and the BBC\u2019s archive are used in a dynamic visualisation enabling users to quickly locate relevant content. This content can then be used by journalists and editors to provide historical context, background information and supporting content around current a\ufb00airs.",

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization is using Semantic Web technologies in the development of the 11th revision of the International Classi\ufb01cation of Diseases (ICD-11). Health o\ufb03cials use ICD in all United Nations member countries to compile basic health statistics, to monitor health-related spending, and to inform policy makers. In 2010, we published a paper in the ISWC In Use track reporting on our experience in the \ufb01rst six months with building and deploying iCAT, a Semantic Web platform to support the collaborative authoring of ICD-11. Three years since our original publication, 270 domain experts around the world have used iCAT to author more than 45,000 classes, to perform more than 260,000 changes, and to create more than 17,000 links to external medical terminologies. During the last three years, the collaboration processes, modeling and tooling have evolved signi\ufb01cantly, and we have learned important lessons, which we will report in this paper. We describe the bene\ufb01ts of using semantic technologies as an infrastructure, which proved to be critical in making support for this rapid evolution possible. To our knowledge, this e\ufb00ort is the only real-world pro ject supporting the collaborative authoring of ontologies at this scale, and which, at the same time, has a high visibility and impact for the health care around the world. We believe that the insights that we gained and the lessons that we learned after four years into this large-scale pro ject will be useful to others who need to support similar collaborative pro jects.",

    "abstract": "We are currently observing a plethora of Natural Language Processing tools and services being made available. Each of the tools and services has its particular strengths and weaknesses, but exploiting the strengths and synergistically combining di\ufb00erent tools is currently an extremely cumbersome and time consuming task. Also, once a particular set of tools is integrated, this integration is not reusable by others. We argue that simplifying the interoperability of di\ufb00erent NLP tools performing similar but also complementary tasks will facilitate the comparability of results and the creation of sophisticated NLP applications. In this paper, we present the NLP Interchange Format (NIF). NIF is based on a Linked Data enabled URI scheme for identifying elements in (hyper-)texts and an ontology for describing common NLP terms and concepts. In contrast to more centralized solutions such as UIMA and GATE, NIF enables the creation of heterogeneous, distributed and loosely coupled NLP applications, which use the Web as an integration platform. We present several use cases of the second version of the NIF speci\ufb01cation (NIF 2.0) and the result of a developer study.",

Additionally, pharmaceutical companies have built up their own extensive private data collections that they require to be included in their pharmacological dataspace. In this paper we discuss the challenges of incorporating private and commercial data into a linked dataspace: focusing on the modelling of these datasets and their interlinking. We also present the graph-based access control mechanism that ensures commercial and private datasets are only available to authorized users.",

    "abstract": "Ontology engineering is a task that is notorious for its di\ufb03culty. As the group that developed Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the most widely used ontology editor, we are keenly aware of how di\ufb03cult the users perceive this task to be. In this paper, we present the new version of WebProt\u00e9g\u00e9 that we designed with two main goals in mind: (1) create a tool that will be easy to use while still accounting for commonly used OWL constructs; (2) support collaboration and social interaction around distributed ontology editing as part of the core tool design. We designed this new version of the WebProt\u00e9g\u00e9 user interface empirically, by analysing the use of OWL constructs in a large corpus of publicly available ontologies. Since the beta release of this new WebProt\u00e9g\u00e9 interface in January 2013, our users from around the world have created and uploaded 519 ontologies on our server. In this paper, we describe the key features of the new tool and our empirical design approach. We evaluate language coverage in WebProt\u00e9g\u00e9 by assessing how well it covers the OWL constructs that are present in ontologies that users have uploaded to WebProt\u00e9g\u00e9. We evaluate the usability of WebProt\u00e9g\u00e9 through a usability survey. Our analysis validates our empirical design, suggests additional language constructors to explore, and demonstrates that an easy-to-use web-based tool that covers most of the frequently used OWL constructs is su\ufb03cient for many users to start editing their ontologies.",

    "abstract": "More and more websites embed structured data describing for instance products, reviews, blog posts, people, organizations, events, and cooking recipes into their HTML pages using markup standards such as Microformats, Microdata and RDFa. This development has accelerated in the last two years as major Web companies, such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo!, and Microsoft, have started to use the embedded data within their applications. In this paper, we analyze the adoption of RDFa, Microdata, and Microformats across the Web. Our study is based on a large public Web crawl dating from early 2012 and consisting of 3 billion HTML pages which originate from over 40 million websites. The analysis reveals the deployment of the different markup standards, the main topical areas of the published data as well as the different vocabularies that are used within each topical area to represent data. What distinguishes our work from earlier studies, published by the large Web companies, is that the analyzed crawl as well as the extracted data are publicly available. This allows our \ufb01ndings to be veri\ufb01ed and to be used as starting points for further domain-speci\ufb01c investigations as well as for focused information extraction endeavors.",

For analyzing this type of data, existing topic modeling approaches, which are highly tailored toward document collections, require manually-de\ufb01ned regularization terms to exploit and to bias the topic learning towards structure information. We propose an approach, called Topical Relational Model, as a principled approach for automatically learning topics from both textual and structure information.

Processing these continuous \ufb02ows of information and capturing insight poses unique technical challenges that span from response time constraints to data heterogeneity, in terms of format and throughput. To tackle these problems, we focus on a novel prototype to ease real-time monitoring and decision-making processes for the City of Dublin with three main original technical aspects: (i) an extension to SPARQL to support ef\ufb01cient querying of heterogeneous streams; (ii) a query execution framework and runtime environment based on IBM InfoSphere Streams, a high-performance, industrial strength, stream processing engine; (iii) a hybrid RDFS reasoner, optimized for our stream processing execution framework. Our approach has been validated with real data collected on the \ufb01eld, as shown in our Dublin City video demonstration. Results indicate that real-time processing of city information streams based on semantic technologies is indeed not only possible, but also ef\ufb01cient, scalable and low-latency.",

One of the barriers for semantic Web novices to create machine-readable data, is the lack of easy-to-use Web publishing tools that separate the schema modelling from the data creation. In this demonstration we present ActiveRaUL, a Web service that supports the automatic generation of Web form-based user interfaces from any input ontology. The resulting Web forms are unique in supporting users, inexperienced in semantic Web technologies, to create and maintain RDF data modelled according to an ontology. We report on a use case based on the Sensor Network Ontology that supports the viability of our approach.",

    "track": "Research Track Paper", 
    "abstract": "Much of Web search and browsing activity is today centered around entities. For this reason, Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs) increasingly contain information about the searched entities such as pictures, short summaries, related entities, and factual information. A key facet that is often displayed on the SERPs and that is instrumental for many applications is the entity type. However, an entity is usually not associated to a single generic type in the background knowledge bases but rather to a set of more speci\ufb01c types, which may be relevant or not given the document context. For example, one can \ufb01nd on the Linked Open Data cloud the fact that Tom Hanks is a person, an actor, and a person from Concord, California. All those types are correct but some may be too general to be interesting (e.g., person), while other may be interesting but already known to the user (e.g., actor), or may be irrelevant given the current browsing context (e.g., person from Concord, California). In this paper, we de\ufb01ne the new task of ranking entity types given an entity and its context. We propose and evaluate new methods to \ufb01nd the most relevant entity type based on collection statistics and on the graph structure interconnecting entities and types. An extensive experimental evaluation over several document collections at di\ufb00erent levels of granularity (e.g., sentences, paragraphs, etc.) and di\ufb00erent type hierarchies (including DBPedia, Freebase, and schema.org) shows that hierarchy-based approaches provide more accurate results when picking entity types to be displayed to the end-user while still being highly scalable.",

It takes as inputs an ontology and a query written according to that ontology, and produces as an output a set of queries that should be evaluated to account for the inferences that should be considered for that query and ontology. Di\ufb00erent query rewriting systems give support to di\ufb00erent ontology languages with varying expressiveness, and the rewritten queries obtained as an output do also vary in expressiveness. This heterogeneity has traditionally made it di\ufb03cult to compare di\ufb00erent approaches, and the area lacks in general commonly agreed benchmarks that could be used not only for such comparisons but also for improving OBDA support. In this paper we compile data, dimensions and measurements that have been used to evaluate some of the most recent systems, we analyse and characterise these assets, and provide a uni\ufb01ed set of them that could be used as a starting point towards a more systematic benchmarking process for such systems. Finally, we apply this initial benchmark with some of the most relevant OBDA approaches in the state of the art.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present the contextual tag cloud system: a novel application that helps users explore a large scale RDF dataset. Unlike folksonomy tags used in most traditional tag clouds, the tags in our system are ontological terms (classes and properties), and a user can construct a context with a set of tags that defines a subset of instances. Then in the contextual tag cloud, the font size of each tag depends on the number of instances that are associated with that tag and all tags in the context. Each contextual tag cloud serves as a summary of the distribution of relevant data, and by changing the context, the user can quickly gain an understanding of patterns in the data. Furthermore, the user can choose to include RDFS taxonomic and/or domain/range entailment in the calculations of tag sizes, thereby understanding the impact of semantics on the data. The system runs on the BTC2012 dataset with more than 1.4 billion triples from which we extract over 380,000 tags. Several scalability challenges must be overcome in order to achieve a responsive interface.",

Most of previous researches focus on reducing the number of MapReduce jobs for processing join operations in SPARQL queries. However, the cost of shuffle phase still occurs due to their reduce-side joins. In this paper, we propose RDFChain which supports the scalable storage and efficient retrieval of a large volume of RDF data using a combination of MapReduce and HBase which is NoSQL storage system. Since the proposed storage schema of RDFChain reflects all the possible join patterns of queries, it provides a reduced number of storage accesses depending on the join pattern of a query. In addition, the proposed cost-based map-side join of RDFChain reduces the number of map jobs since it processes as many joins as possible in a map job using statistics.",

    "abstract": "Experimentation is an important way to validate results of Semantic Web and Computer Science research in general. In this paper, we investigate the development and the current status of experimental work on the Semantic Web. Based on a corpus of 500 papers collected from the International Semantic Web Conferences (ISWC) over the past decade, we analyse the importance and the quality of experimental research conducted and compare it to general Computer Science. We observe that the amount and quality of experiments are steadily increasing over time. Unlike hypothesised, we cannot con\ufb01rm a statistically signi\ufb01cant correlation between a paper\u2019s citations and the amount of experimental work reported. Our analysis, however, shows that papers comparing themselves to other systems are more often cited than other papers.",

To that end it leverages a novel, graph-based architecture.  Specifically, TripleRush is built on our parallel and distributed graph processing framework Signal/Collect. The index structure is represented as a graph where each index vertex corresponds to a triple pattern. Partially matched queries are routed in parallel along different paths of this index structure.  We show experimentally that TripleRush takes about a third of the time to answer queries compared to the fastest of three state-of-the-art triple stores, when measuring time as the geometric mean of all queries for two common benchmarks.",

Only the R2RML mapping language was standardized but its applicability is limited to mappings from relational databases to RDF. We propose the extension of R2RML to also support mappings of data sources in other structured formats. Broadening its scope, the focus is put on the mappings and their optimal reuse. The language becomes source-agnostic, and resources are integrated and interlinked at a primary stage.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss PigSPARQL, a competitive, yet easy to use, SPARQL query processing system based on MapReduce and thus intended for Big Data applications. Instead of a direct mapping, PigSPARQL uses the query language of Pig, a data analysis platform on top of Hadoop, as an intermediate layer between SPARQL and MapReduce. The additional level of abstraction makes our approach independent of the actual Hadoop version. Thus, it is automatically compatible to future changes of the Hadoop framework as they will be neutralized by the Pig layer and allows ad-hoc SPARQL query processing on large RDF graphs out of the box. In the paper we first revisit PigSPARQL and demonstrate PigSPARQL's gain of efficiency simply because switching from version Pig 0.5.0 to Pig 0.11.0. Because of this sustainability, PigSPARQL is an attractive long-term baseline for comparing various MapReduce based SPARQL implementations. This is underlined by PigSPARQL's competitiveness with existing systems, e.g. HadoopRDF.",

In this paper, we introduce a processing pipeline to automatically assess, annotate and index available linked datasets. Given a minimal description of a dataset from the DataHub, the process produces a structured RDF-based description that includes information about its main topics. Additionally, the generated descriptions embed datasets into an interlinked graph of datasets based on shared topic vocabularies. We adopt and integrate techniques for Named Entity Recognition and automated data validation, providing a consistent workflow for dataset profiling and annotation. Finally, we validate the results obtained with our tool.",

In this paper, we show how uncertain extractions about entities and their relations can be transformed into a know ledge graph. The extractions form an extraction graph and we refer to the task of removing noise, inferring missing information, and determining which candidate facts should be included into a knowledge graph as know ledge graph identi\ufb01cation. In order to perform this task, we must reason jointly about candidate facts and their associated extraction con\ufb01dences, identify coreferent entities, and incorporate ontological constraints. Our proposed approach uses probabilistic soft logic (PSL), a recently introduced probabilistic modeling framework which easily scales to millions of facts. We demonstrate the power of our method on a synthetic Linked Data corpus derived from the MusicBrainz music community and a real-world set of extractions from the NELL pro ject containing over 1M extractions and 70K ontological relations. We show that compared to existing methods, our approach is able to achieve improved AUC and F1 with signi\ufb01cantly lower running time.",

    "track": "Research Track Paper", 
    "abstract": "With hundreds, if not thousands, of ontologies available today in many di\ufb00erent domains, ontology search and ranking has become an important and timely problem. When a user searches a collection of ontologies for her terms of interest, there are often dozens of ontologies that contain these terms. How does she know which ontology is the most relevant to her search? Our research group hosts BioPortal, a public repository of more than 330 ontologies in the biomedical domain. When a term that a user searches for is available in multiple ontologies, how do we rank the results and how do we measure how well our ranking works? In this paper, we develop an evaluation framework that enables developers to compare and analyze the performance of di\ufb00erent ontology-ranking methods. Our framework is based on processing search logs and determining how often users select the top link that the search engine o\ufb00ers. We evaluate our framework by analyzing the data on BioPortal searches. We explore several di\ufb00erent ranking algorithms and measure the e\ufb00ectiveness of each ranking by measuring how often users click on the highest ranked ontology. We collected log data from more than 4,800 BioPortal searches. Our results show that regardless of the ranking, in more than half the searches, users select the \ufb01rst link. Thus, it is even more critical to ensure that the ranking is appropriate if we want to have satis\ufb01ed users. Our further analysis demonstrates that ranking ontologies based on page view data signi\ufb01cantly improves the user experience, with an approximately 26% increase in the number of users who select the highest ranked ontology for the search.",

While incremental classi\ufb01cation modulo additions is relatively straightforward, handling deletions is more problematic since it requires retracting logical consequences that are no longer valid. Known algorithms address this problem using various forms of bookkeeping to trace the consequences back to premises. But such additional data can consume memory and place an extra burden on the reasoner during application of inferences. In this paper, we present a technique, which avoids this extra cost while being very ef\ufb01cient for small incremental changes in ontologies. The technique is freely available as a part of the open-source E L reasoner ELK and its ef\ufb01ciency is demonstrated on naturally occurring and synthetic data.",

    "abstract": "For ontology reuse and integration, a number of approaches have been devised that aim at identifying modules, i.e., suitably small sets of \u201crelevant\u201d axioms from ontologies. Here we consider three logically sound notions of modules: MEX modules, only applicable to inexpressive ontologies; modules based on semantic locality, a sound approximation of the \ufb01rst; and modules based on syntactic locality, a sound approximation of the second (and thus the \ufb01rst), widely used since these modules can be extracted from OWL DL ontologies in time polynomial in the size of the ontology. In this paper we investigate the quality of both approximations over a large corpus of ontologies, using our own implementation of semantic locality, which is the \ufb01rst to our knowledge. In particular, we show with statistical signi\ufb01cance that, in most cases, there is no di\ufb00erence between the two module notions based on locality; where they di\ufb00er, the additional axioms can either be easily ruled out or their number is relatively small. We classify the axioms that explain the rare di\ufb00erences into four kinds of \u201cculprits\u201d and discuss which of those can be avoided by extending the de\ufb01nition of syntactic locality. Finally, we show that di\ufb00erences between MEX and locality-based modules occur for a minority of ontologies from our corpus and largely a\ufb00ect (approximations of ) expressive ontologies \u2013 this conclusion relies on a much larger and more diverse sample than existing comparisons between MEX and syntactic locality-based modules.",

    "abstract": "Despite the large number and variety of tools and services available today for exploring scholarly data, current support is still very limited in the context of sensemaking tasks, which go beyond standard search and ranking of authors and publications, and focus instead on i) understanding the dynamics of research areas, ii) relating authors \u2018semantically\u2019 (e.g., in terms of common interests or shared academic trajectories), or iii) performing fine-grained academic expert search along multiple dimensions. To address this gap we have developed a novel tool, Rexplore, which integrates statistical analysis, semantic technologies, and visual analytics to provide effective support for exploring and making sense of scholarly data. Here, we describe the main innovative elements of the tool and we present the results from a task-centric empirical evaluation, which shows that Rexplore is highly effective at providing support for the aforementioned sensemaking tasks. In addition, these results are robust both with respect to the background of the users (i.e., expert analysts vs. \u2018ordinary\u2019 users) and also with respect to whether the tasks are selected by the evaluators or proposed by the users themselves.",

    "track": "Research Track Paper", 
    "abstract": "Nowadays, search on the Web goes beyond the retrieval of textual Web sites and increasingly takes advantage of the growing amount of structured data. Of particular interest is entity search, where the units of retrieval are structured entities instead of textual documents. These entities reside in di\ufb00erent sources, which may provide only limited information about their content and are therefore called \u201cuncooperative\u201d. Further, these sources capture complementary but also redundant information about entities. In this environment of uncooperative data sources, we study the problem of federated entity search, where redundant information about entities is reduced on-the-\ufb02y through entity consolidation performed at query time. We propose a novel method for entity consolidation that is based on using language models and completely unsupervised, hence more suitable for this on-the-\ufb02y uncooperative setting than state-of-the-art methods that require training data. Further, we apply the same language model technique to deal with the federated search problem of ranking results returned from di\ufb00erent sources. Particular novel are the mechanisms we propose to incorporate consolidation results into this ranking. We perform experiments using real Web queries and data sources. Our experiments show that our approach for federated entity search with on-the-\ufb02y consolidation improves upon the performance of a state-of-the-art preference aggregation baseline and also bene\ufb01ts from consolidation.",

    "abstract": "Over the last years the Web of Data has developed into a large compendium of interlinked data sets from multiple domains. Due to the decentralised architecture of this compendium, several of these datasets contain duplicated data. Yet, so far, only little attention has been paid to the e\ufb00ect of duplicated data on federated querying. This work presents DAW, a novel duplicate-aware approach to federated querying over the Web of Data. DAW is based on a combination of min-wise independent permutations and compact data summaries. It can be directly combined with existing federated query engines in order to achieve the same query recall values while querying fewer data sources. We extend three well-known federated query processing engines \u2013 DARQ, SPLENDID, and FedX \u2013 with DAW and compare our extensions with the original approaches. The comparison shows that DAW can greatly reduce the number of queries sent to the endpoints, while keeping high query recall values. Therefore, it can signi\ufb01cantly improve the performance of federated query processing engines. Moreover, DAW provides a source selection mechanism that maximises the query recall, when the query processing is limited to a subset of the sources.",

    "abstract": "Wikipedia\u2019s infoboxes contain rich structured information of various entities, which have been explored by the DBpedia pro ject to generate large scale Linked Data sets. Among all the infobox attributes, those attributes having hyperlinks in its values identify semantic relations between entities, which are important for creating RDF links between DBpedia\u2019s instances. However, quite a few hyperlinks have not been anotated by editors in infoboxes, which causes lots of relations between entities being missing in Wikipedia. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatically discovering the missing entity links in Wikipedia\u2019s infoboxes, so that the missing semantic relations between entities can be established. Our approach \ufb01rst identi\ufb01es entity mentions in the given infoboxes, and then computes several features to estimate the possibilities that a given attribute value might link to a candidate entity. A learning model is used to obtain the weights of di\ufb00erent features, and predict the destination entity for each attribute value. We evaluated our approach on the English Wikipedia data, the experimental results show that our approach can e\ufb00ectively \ufb01nd the missing relations between entities, and it signi\ufb01cantly outperforms the baseline methods in terms of both precision and recall.",

    "track": "Research Track Paper", 
    "abstract": "One of the main advantages of using semantically annotated data is that machines can reason on it, deriving implicit knowledge from explicit information. In this context, materializing every possible implicit derivation from a given input can be computationally expensive, especially when considering large data volumes. Most of the solutions that address this problem rely on the assumption that the information is static, i.e., that it does not change, or changes very infrequently. However, the Web is extremely dynamic: online newspapers, blogs, social networks, etc., are frequently changed so that outdated information is removed and replaced with fresh data. This demands for a materialization that is not only scalable, but also reactive to changes. In this paper, we consider the problem of incremental materialization, that is, how to update the materialized derivations when new data is added or removed. To this purpose, we consider the \u03c1df RDFS fragment [12], and present a parallel system that implements a number of algorithms to quickly recalculate the derivation. In case new data is added, our system uses a parallel version of the well-known semi-naive evaluation of Datalog. In case of removals, we have implemented two algorithms, one based on previous theoretical work, and another one that is more e\ufb03cient since it does not require a complete scan of the input. We have evaluated the performance using a prototype system called DynamiTE , which organizes the knowledge bases with a number of indices to facilitate the query process and exploits parallelism to improve the performance. The results show that our methods are indeed capable to recalculate the derivation in a short time, opening the door to reasoning on much more dynamic data than is currently possible.",

    "title": "On Correctness in RDF stream processor benchmarking", 
    "track": "Evaluation Track Paper", 
    "abstract": "Two complementary benchmarks have been proposed so far for the evaluation and continuous improvement of RDF stream processors: SRBench and LSBench. They put a special focus on di\ufb00erent features of the evaluated systems, including coverage of the streaming extensions of SPARQL supported by each processor, query processing throughput, and an early analysis of query evaluation correctness, based on comparing the results obtained by di\ufb00erent processors for a set of queries. However, none of them has analysed the operational semantics of these processors in order to assess the correctness of query evaluation results. In this paper, we propose a characterization of the operational semantics of RDF stream processors, adapting well-known models used in the stream processing engine community: CQL and SECRET. Through this formalization, we address correctness in RDF stream processor benchmarks, allowing to determine the multiple answers that systems should provide. Finally, we present CSRBench, an extension of SRBench to address query result correctness veri\ufb01cation using an automatic method.",

It does so by studying full as well as fractional factorial experiments designed to evaluate an assertion that some change introduced in a system has improved performance. This paper does not present a \ufb01nished experimental design, rather its main focus is didactical, to shift the focus of the community away from benchmarking towards higher scienti\ufb01c rigor.",

We motivate and describe this use case and its characteristics and discuss why traditional, F-measure based evaluation measures are not suitable for this use case. Therefore, we investigate several alternative evaluation measures and propose the use of Precision@N curves as a mean to assess different matching systems for supervised matching. We compare the ranking of several state of the art matchers using Precision@N curves to the traditional F-measure based ranking, and discuss means to combine matchers in a way that optimizes the user support in supervised ontology matching.",

    "track": "Evaluation Track Paper", 
    "abstract": "Query containment is the problem of deciding if the answers to a query are included in those of another query for any queried database. This problem is very important for query optimization purposes. In the SPARQL context, it can be equally useful. This problem has recently been investigated theoretically and some query containment solvers are available. Yet, there were no benchmarks to compare theses systems and foster their improvement. In order to experimentally assess implementation strengths and limitations, we provide a rst SPARQL containment test benchmark. It has been designed with respect to both the capabilities of existing solvers and the study of typical queries. Some solvers support optional constructs and cycles, while other solvers support pro jection, union of conjunctive queries and RDF Schemas. No solver currently supports all these features or OWL entailment regimes. The study of query demographics on DBPedia logs shows that the vast ma jority of queries are acyclic and a signicant part of them uses UNION or pro jection. We thus test available solvers on their domain of applicability on three dierent benchmark suites. These experiments show that (i) tested solutions are overall functionally correct, (ii) in spite of its complexity, SPARQL query containment is practicable for acyclic queries, (iii) state-of-the-art solvers are at an early stage both in terms of capability and implementation.",

We analyzed the most common errors encountered in Linked Data sources and classi\ufb01ed them according to the extent to which they are likely to be amenable to a speci\ufb01c form of crowdsourcing. Based on this analysis, we implemented a quality assessment methodology for Linked Data that leverages the wisdom of the crowds in different ways: (i) a contest targeting an expert crowd of researchers and Linked Data enthusiasts; complemented by (ii) paid microtasks published on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We empirically evaluated how this methodology could ef\ufb01ciently spot quality issues in DBpedia. We also investigated how the contributions of the two types of crowds could be optimally integrated into Linked Data curation processes. The results show that the two styles of crowdsourcing are complementary and that crowdsourcing-enabled quality assessment is a promising and affordable way to enhance the quality of Linked Data.",

Using the stored knowledge the system can provide users valuable functionalities such as semantic search, finding potential bug duplicates, custom notifications and issue recommendations.",

The vast ma jority of ontology alignment systems use one or more string similarity metrics, but often the choice of which metrics to use is not given much attention. In this work we evaluate a wide range of such metrics, along with string pre-processing strategies such as removing stop words and considering synonyms, on di\ufb00erent types of ontologies. We also present a set of guidelines on when to use which metric. We furthermore show that if optimal string similarity metrics are chosen, those alone can produce alignments that are competitive with the state of the art in ontology alignment systems. Finally, we examine the improvements possible to an existing ontology alignment system using an automated string metric selection strategy based upon the characteristics of the ontologies to be aligned.",

But is this infrastructure mature enough to support applications? For 427 public SPARQL endpoints registered on the DataHub, we conduct various experiments to test their maturity. Regarding discoverability, we nd that only one-third of endpoints make descriptive meta-data available, making it dicult to locate or learn about their content and capabilities. Regarding interoperability, we nd patchy support for established SPARQL features like ORDER BY as well as (understandably) for new SPARQL 1.1 features. Regarding eciency, we show that the performance of endpoints for generic queries can vary by up to 34 orders of magnitude. Regarding availability, based on a 27-month long monitoring experiment, we show that only 32.2% of public endpoints can be expected to have (monthly) two-nines uptimes of 99100%.",

It is currently not possible to provide a semantic solution to their problem primarily due to the non-availability of comprehensive semantic datasets in the domains of information technology. In this work, we have extracted, integrated and curated a linked open dataset (LOD) called LOaD-IT exclusively on this domain from a variety of sources including other LODs such as Freebase and DBPedia, technical documentation such as JavaDocs and others. Further, we have built a technical helpdesk system using a semantic query engine that derives answers from LOaD-IT. Our system demonstrates how productivity of the software engineer can be improved by eliminating the need to read through lengthy technical manuals. We expect LOaD-IT to become more comprehensive in the future and to find other related practical applications.",

This technique makes the CEDAR reasoner perform on a par with the best systems for concept classification and several orders-of-magnitude more efficiently in terms of response time for query-answering.  The experiments were carried out using very large taxonomies (Wikipedia: 111599 sorts, MESH: 286381 sorts, NCBI: 903617 sorts and Biomodels: 182651 sorts).

    "abstract": "We present our work on developing a software platform for mining mathematical scholarly papers to obtain a Linked Data representation. Currently, the Linking Open Data (LOD) cloud lacks up-to-date and detailed information on professional level mathematics. To our mind, the main reason for that is the absence of appropriate tools that could analyze the underlying semantics in mathematical papers and e\ufb00ectively build their consolidated representation. We have developed a holistic approach to analysis of mathematical documents, including ontology based extraction, conversion of the article body as well as its metadata into RDF, integration with some existing LOD data sets, and semantic search. We argue that the platform may be helpful for enriching user experience on modern online scienti\ufb01c collections.",

In this paper, we show how in the case of Horn ontologies one can exploit the lower and upper bounds computed by the RL reasoner to e\ufb03ciently identify a subset of the data and ontology that is large enough to resolve the status of these tuples, yet small enough so that the status can be computed using a fully-\ufb02edged OWL 2 reasoner.

The most challenging issue we have to deal with when designing such a decision procedure is to represent in\ufb01nitely non-tree-shaped models, which are different from those of SHOIQ ontologies.

Empirical activities often resort to (somewhat arbitrarily) hand curated corpora available on the web, such as the NCBO BioPortal and the TONES Repository, or manually selected sets of well-known ontologies. Findings of surveys and results of benchmarking activities may be biased, even heavily, towards these datasets. Sampling from a large corpus of ontologies, on the other hand, may lead to more representative results. Current large scale repositories and web crawls are mostly uncurated and su\ufb00er from duplication, small and (for many purposes) uninteresting ontology \ufb01les, and contain large numbers of ontology versions, variants, and facets, and therefore do not lend themselves to random sampling. In this paper, we survey ontologies as they exist on the web and describe the creation of a corpus of OWL DL ontologies using strategies such as web crawling, various forms of de-duplications and manual cleaning, which allows random sampling of ontologies for a variety of empirical applications.",

    "abstract": "Semantic models of data sources and services provide support to automate many tasks such as source discovery, data integration, and service composition, but writing these semantic descriptions by hand is a tedious and time-consuming task. Most of the related work focuses on automatic annotation with classes or properties of source attributes or input and output parameters. However, constructing a source model that includes the relationships between the attributes in addition to their semantic types remains a largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we present a graph-based approach to hypothesize a rich semantic description of a new target source from a set of known sources that have been modeled over the same domain ontology. We exploit the domain ontology and the known source models to build a graph that represents the space of plausible source descriptions. Then, we compute the top k candidates and suggest to the user a ranked list of the semantic models for the new source. The approach takes into account user corrections to learn more accurate semantic descriptions of future data sources. Our evaluation shows that our method produces models that are twice as accurate than the models produced using a state of the art system that does not learn from prior models.",

Our approach uses the well-founded semantics for MKNF knowledge bases as underlying formalism, so no restriction other than DL-safety is imposed on the rules that can be written. The tool itself builds on the procedure SLG(O) and, with the help of OWL 2 EL reasoner ELK, pre-processes the ontology into rules, whose result together with the non-monotonic rules serve as input for the topdown querying engine XSB Prolog. With the resulting plug-in, even queries to very large ontologies, such as SNOMED CT, augmented with a large number of rules, can be processed at an interactive response time after one initial brief pre-processing period. At the same time, our system is able to deal with possible inconsistencies between the rules and an ontology that alone is consistent.",

The telecomoperators own and manage billions of mobile network events (like the Call DetailedRecords - CDR) per day: the interpretation of such a big stream of dataneeds a deep understanding of the context where the events have occurred. Theexploitation of available background knowledge is a key element in this scenario.In this paper we introduce a novel method for the semantic interpretation of humanbehavior in mobility based on the merge of the mobile network data streamand the geo-referred available background knowledge. We modeled the humanbehavior making use of the geo and time-referenced knowledge available on theweb (e.g., geo-tagged resources, info on weather forecast, social events, etc.)matching it with the mobile network coverage map. The model is intended tocharacterize the contexts where the mobile network events occur in order to helpin interpreting the behavioral traits that generated by them. This will allow us toachieve a set of predictive tasks such as the prediction of human activities in certain contextual conditions (e.g., when an accident occurs on highway before theworking time starts, etc.), or the characterization of exceptional events detectedfrom anomalies in mobile network data.We created an ontological and stochastic high-level representation behavioralmodel (HRBModel) that maps the human activities to the different contexts.Given the mobile phone network and the geo-tagged resource Openstreetmap,the model is used to rank the activities associated to a particular network event(e.g. a sudden call amount peak) according to their probability. We also describethe design of an experimental evaluation and the preliminary evaluation resultsto measure the performance of the model and to improve the activity predictiontask.",

    "abstract": "Ontology Based Data Access (OBDA) enables access to relational data with a complex structure through ontologies as conceptual domain models. To this end, mappings are required. A key aim of OBDA is to facilitate access to data with a complex structure. Ironically, though, in today\u2019s existing OBDA systems mappings typically need to be compiled by hand, which is a complex and labor intensive task. Additionally, existing semi-automatic mapping approaches su\ufb00er from high human e\ufb00ort for cleaning up results. Fully automatic approaches, on the other side, su\ufb00er from a lack of precision and/or recall. In setups where the correctness of query results is crucial but the initial human e\ufb00ort must still be kept be small as possible, neither approach is acceptable. This situation calls for a guided, pay as you go feedback process for human mapping validation. We envision a comprehensive suite of methods and techniques that work well with one another in a seamless mapping process and support mapping construction in the context of OBDA. This suite will in part consist of a recombination and adaptation of various existing methods, but will also comprise newly devised algorithms and techniques.",

    "abstract": "As the scale and complexity of ontologies increases, so too do errors and engineering challenges. It is frequently unclear, however, to what degree extralogical ontology errors negatively affect the application that the ontology underpins. For example, \u201cShoe SubClassOf Foot\u201d may be correct logically, but not in a human interpretation. Indeed, such errors, not caught by reasoning, are likely to be domain-speci\ufb01c, and thus identifying salient ontology errors requires consideration of the domain. There are both automated and manual methods that provide ontology quality assurance. Nevertheless, these methods do not readily scale as ontology size increases, and do not necessarily identify the most salient extralogical errors. Recently, crowdsourcing has enabled solutions to complex problems that computers alone cannot solve. For instance, human workers can quickly and more accurately identify objects in images at scale. Crowdsourcing presents an opportunity to develop methods for ontology quality assurance that overcome the current limitations of scalability and applicability. In this work, I aim (1) to determine the effect of extralogical ontology errors in an example domain, (2) to develop a scalable framework for crowdsourcing ontology veri\ufb01cation that overcomes current ontology Q/A method limitations, and (3) to apply this framework to ontologies in use. I will then evaluate the method itself and also its effect in the context of a speci\ufb01c domain. As an example domain, I will use biomedicine, which applies many large-scale ontologies. Thus, this work will enable scalable quality assurance for extralogical errors in biomedical ontologies.",

    "abstract": "Due to the abundance of content on the Web, content authors and publishers have a pressing need for systems that select content that is valuable for them, is trustworthy and is related to their own work. Additionally, the value of their own work needs to be assessed before it is published, to guarantee high value for the consumer. In this doctoral research, we investigate how to use Semantic Web technologies to automatically assess the value of content that is \u2013 or is about to be \u2013 digitally published. To achieve this, we propose methods to assess the relevance of content to existing publications, retrieve or reconstruct its provenance, and derive a trust assessment from this provenance. We discuss our evaluation methods, and present some preliminary results.",

    "track": "Doctoral Consortium Paper", 
    "abstract": "As data collections become established in key disciplines, some of the longstanding barriers to data sharing become to dissolve; yet others remain. While metadata and ontologies help overcome the problems of finding and interpreting data, the lack of clarity over licensing remains a real impediment to data reuse. Freedom from legal restriction and uncertainty is essential for the effective sharing, combining and deriving of data from these distributed collections. Reuse and recombination of data will be greatly facilitated by expanding the definition of the semantic web to include the semantics of data licensing. We aim to express licensing terms in a computable manner, within the context of research practice, enabling us to infer the resulting state of rights, obligations and conditions that are inherited by derived and recombined datasets, using a mixed bag of licenses. Building off this we aim to simulate the effects of varying licensing practices within communities, proposing a measure of health of our scholarly record based on compatibility and restrictiveness of the licenses contained therein.",

We propose amethodology to annotate table headers with semantic type informationbased on the content of column\u2019s cells. In our experiments on 50 tableswe achieved an F1 value of 0.55, where the accuracy greatly varies de-pending on the used ontology. Regarding computational complexity wefound out that 94% of the maximal F1 score on average 20 cells (37%)need to be considered. Results suggest that the choice of the ontologyplays a more crucial role for type inference than the number of cells used.",

    "abstract": "In spite of the recent renaissance in lightweight description logics (DLs), many prominent DLs, such as that underlying the Web Ontology Language (OWL), have high worst case complexity for their key inference services. Modern reasoners have a large array of optimization, tuned calculi, and implementation tricks that allow them to perform very well in a variety of application scenarios, even though the complexity results ensure that they will perform poorly for some inputs. For users, the key question is how often they will encounter those pathological inputs in practice, that is, how robust are reasoners. We attempt to determine this question for classification of existing ontologies as they are found on the Web. It is a fairly common user task to examine ontologies published on the Web as part of their development process. Thus, the robustness of reasoners in this scenario is both directly interesting and provides some hints toward answering the broader question. From our experiments, we show that the current crop of OWL reasoners, in collaboration, is very robust against the Web.",
