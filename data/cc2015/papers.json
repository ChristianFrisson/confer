    "abstract": "The term design fiction was first used in 2005 by Bruce Sterling [18:30] and in 2009 Julian Bleecker built on the idea by combining it with various other characterisations [cf. 1,2,10] and catalysed a step change in design fiction discourse. Since then design fiction has gained significant traction across academic contexts; at symposia and conference events; and through its practice within commercial design studios and industry. Despite becoming a popular way of framing speculative design, the characterisation of design fiction as research approach still remains \u008a\u0097\u0093up for grabs\u008a\u0097\u009d [19:22] as it is \u008a\u0097\u0093enticing and provocative, yet [\u008a\u0097_] remains elusive\u008a\u0097\u009d [7:1].

This paper discusses research to expand and refine the formulation of distributed affect as a theoretical framework for analyzing and understanding creative collaboration. I elaborate on parallels between theories of cognition that extend beyond the individual as the unit of analysis and the text-based chat communication of affect between members of a distributed group who utilize creative problem solving to achieve their goals. Directions for future research are also discussed. A better understanding of the way in which distributed affect operates will have a significant impact on research into collaborative creativity as well as implications for the design of interfaces to support this type of distributed work.",

    "abstract": "Urban knitting (also known as yarn bombing, knitted graffiti and guerilla knitting) is a globally occurring street art trend which uses traditional craft techniques to modify objects in urban space. It is the chosen tool of present-day craftspeople for creative expression in public. However, the personal narratives woven into the installations usually remain inaccessible for the broad audience. This paper presents my Master's thesis work on \"Tools for Wools\", an interactive prototype which integrates physical wool panels, touch sensors and an information device with intent to fill the identified information gap. The subsequent evaluation allowed insights on the manifold reasons for urban knitters to engage in this particular form of everyday creativity. I therefore suggest that such prototype projects can also serve as a qualitative research tool to reveal motivations underlying creative craft practices.",

    "abstract": "How best to assess the creativity of a large number of designed artifacts remains an open problem. The typical approach is to have a panel of experts answer likert questions about individual artifacts. This process typically requires a substantial amount of training to ensure the judges achieve an acceptable level of agreement. Consequently, the approach does not scale well as it is infeasible to have a panel of experts regularly evaluate the creativity of a large number of designs. The current work explores an alternative approach that uses both individual and pairwise judgements from novice crowd workers to support reliable and scalable assessment of creative designs. This approach, which we call TrueCreativity, can operate over a set of evaluations from a large number of judges and appropriately weights their evaluations based on their past reliability and agreement with other judges.  We show that this approach produces results that strongly correlate with another measure of creativity. ",

Our approach builds upon recent work in computational creativity called interactive machine learning (IML). In IML, agents learn through demonstration, interaction, and real time feedback from a human user (as opposed to offline training). To apply IML to open-ended creative collaboration, we developed an enactive model of creativity (EMC) based upon the cognitive science theories of enaction.

    "abstract": "While universities teach students how to build new products, few students choose to further implement their work due to limited resources and mentorship. Theories of learning and innovation describe the importance of working in a social context to acquire resources from peers. While HCI researchers have built recommender and expert routing systems to identify help givers, novice designers still fail to contact expert peers for various psychological reasons, such as fear of contacting someone older or more experienced. By designing online tools and platforms that encourage and scaffold that act of help-seeking, we can connect more designers with informal mentors who can help them improve and implement their work as a professional product. The goal of my dissertation is to support help-seeking among novice designers by 1) developing an emergent model of help-seeking behavior in the context of crowdfunding, and building a tool that 2) recommends potential help-givers from one\u008a\u0097\u00c8s social network and 3) presents their information in a way that encourages reaching out for advice.

    "abstract": "In studying cognitive activity in design it is common practice to use designers\u008a\u0097\u00c8 verbalizations during a design process to elicit the reasoning behind design actions. These verbalizations are segmented in order to enable a quantifiable analysis of the cognitive processes. Researchers have shown how Shannon\u008a\u0097\u00c8s entropy can be applied to coded verbal data to provide a measure of creativity of those processes. We applied this method to a pilot study, investigating the effects of different design tools on creativity in the context of architectural design. Participants had to design three tasks of isomorphic nature, each with a different tool, in one design session. As shown a significant number of verbal comments were repetitions of already established ideas. Such comments brought nothing new to the sequence of activities but affected the value of information carried within that process which biased the measure of creativity. The paper regards these utterance as verbal noise. It proposes the use of corpus linguistic tools together with a coding scheme that can depict the hierarchical relationship of cognitive patterns used in the process to eliminate verbal noise from analysis. The method was applied to one participant\u008a\u0097\u00c8s data, which shows a promising step in increasing the veracity of using verbal data in analyzing cognitive activity. ",

    "abstract": "As computing increasingly deals with our complex daily experiences, designers are challenged with new methods and ways of implementing complex interactions in limited user space and tools, but without hindering user experience and creativity. In this paper, we present the results of an empirical investigation regarding the effect of space and tool availability on user experience and creativity. The goal is to understand whether and how space and tool availability allow users to be more creative and improve their overall experience. To do so, we developed a connect-the-dots drawing multi-user application with a focus on having certain restrictions in size and specific tool availability. Based on this application, we conducted an empirical study with 38 users. For the evaluation, surveys, photos and observations were recorded and used in our analysis. The results showed that: (a) tool availability does not affect user creativity and experience and (b) space availability affects user creativity, collaboration and hedonic motivation (pleasure).

    "abstract": "Creativity thrives when people experience positive emotions. How to design an interactive system that can effectively make use of this potential is, however, still an unanswered question. In this paper, we propose one approach to this problem that relies on hacking into the cognitive appraisal processes that form part of positive emotions. To demonstrate our approach we have conceived, made, and evaluated a novel interactive system that influences an individual_\u0084\u008es appraisals of their own idea generation processes by providing real-time and believable feedback about the originality of their ideas. The system can be used to manipulate this feedback to make the user_\u0084\u008es ideas appear more or less original. This has enabled us to test experimentally the hypothesis that providing more positive feedback, rather than neutral, or more negative feedback than the user is expecting, causes more positive emotion, which in turn causes more creativity during idea generation. The findings demonstrate that an interactive system can be designed to use the function of cognitive appraisal processes in positive emotion to help people to get more out of their own creative capabilities.",

Drawing on ethnographic research focusing on participation in creative activities for people with dementia living in care, the paper details how residents engaged with technologies (such as television) in a passive way (spending hours sitting in front of the TV without engaging with others around them), and in an active way (singing and dancing to music played via stereo and record player). Findings from this research emphasise the importance for interaction design for dementia in appreciating the role of active creative participation in sustaining personhood in dementia.

    "abstract": "Emerging online ideation platforms with thousands of example ideas provide an important resource for creative production. But how can ideators best use these examples to create new innovations? Recent work has suggested that not just the choice of examples, but also the timing of their delivery can impact creative outcomes. Building on existing cognitive theories of creative insight, we hypothesize that people are likely to benefit from examples when they run out of ideas. We explore two example delivery mechanisms that test this hypothesis: 1) a system that proactively provides examples when a user appears to have run out of ideas, and 2) a system that provides examples when a user explicitly requests them. Our online experiment (N=97) compared these two mechanisms against two baselines: providing no examples and automatically showing examples at a regular interval. Participants who requested examples themselves generated ideas that were rated the most novel by external evaluators. Participants who received ideas automatically when they appeared to be stuck produced the most ideas. Importantly, participants who received examples at a regular interval generated fewer ideas than participants who received no examples, suggesting that mere access to examples is not sufficient for creative inspiration. These results emphasize the importance of the timing of  example delivery. Insights from this study can inform the design of collective ideation support systems that help people generate many high quality ideas.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the potential of a pervasive user experience to inspire, provoke and support creative thinking amongst participants in an intensive ideation workshop. The pervasive experience used a iPad-based virtual narrator to guide groups of participants around a physical and digital environment. It took place towards the start of a three-day workshop and the playful, self-directed nature of the experience was designed to align with subsequent workshop activities. This paper describes the user experience, presenting observations and findings through the lens of space (facilitation, augmentation and story), considering how the experience related to and supported the overall workshop aims of ideation and creative thinking. We conclude by examining some of the tensions that emerged, namely; 1) the disconnect between researcher and participant expectations, 2) the potential trade off between _\u0084\u0083authentic_\u0084\u008e outputs and participant engagement, and 3) bridging the knowledge within the workshop with the world outside the workshop.",

    "abstract": "The creative promise of 3D digital fabrication tools is tremendous. However due to the wide range of tools and interfaces, a common static file format called STL is used for sharing designs. While customization tools add creative handles to these digital models, they are often constrained to pre-configured parameters limiting the creative potential of shared digital models. We introduce MetaMorphe, a novel digital fabrication framework that uses a common web-programming metaphor to enable users to easily transform static 3D models into re-formed, re-made, and re-imagined customized personal artifacts. We demonstrate the compatibility of MetaMorphe with three well-established design interfaces, direction manipulation, scripted-CAD, and generative design. Through a user study with design experts, MetaMorphe reveals that decisions that physically produce bespoke artifacts or encode unique metadata actively affect perceptions of authorship, agency, and authenticity. We discuss how expressive model-building tools such as MetaMorphe enable a cultural shift in 3D design in terms of participation, personalization, and creativity.",

These reveal requirements and challenges for the design process as well as the effective staging of interactive costumes, the biggest challenge being how to integrate these into existing structures of traditional theatre houses, and requirements for the costumes themselves. Because interactive costumes integrate technological features and traditional analogue crafts, they require interdisciplinary collaboration and transcend established boundaries between departments in theatre houses, challenging established work processes and structures.",

    "abstract": "The traditional approach for developing assistive technologies for blind and visually impaired users is to focus on problems and to try and resolve them by compensating for the loss of vision. In this research we took the approach of involving blind and visually impaired people, from a range of ages, in a hands-on making activity using an eTextile physical computing toolkit. Our aim was to create an environment where people could both make and learn form each other, but also where they would share their thoughts and imagine future scenarios for the technologies they were developing. We observed highly creative ways of working at all levels, from unique weaving techniques to choices in fabrics and materials, as well as expressions of personal preferences. We discuss the _\u0084\u0083in-home enjoyment_\u0084\u008e scenarios sketched by the participants and point to the role of creative workshops and eTextile toolkits as a tool for imagining future technologies.

    "abstract": "Creativity support tools help learners undertake creative work, such as facilitating coaching by creative professionals. How might we design creativity support tools that in-crease learners_\u0084\u008e access to coaching by creative professionals? This study took place in an extracurricular project-based learning program where students were co-located, and met professional coaches face-to-face once a week but otherwise communicated online. To test an online creativity support tool called the Loft and investigate coach-student communication we collected data from 47 interviews, online log data and field observations. We found that (a) explicit help-seeking was rare outside of meetings, (b) help from professionals was highly-valued but not sought out, and (c) online systems could surface learner struggles and trigger help-giving.  Our findings suggested that online creativity platforms can support professional coaching through: (1) structured virtual updates (2) coach thanking, (3) Computer-Supported Group Critique, (4) disclosure of expertise, and (5) help-seeking training.

    "abstract": "Feedback is important to the creative process, but not everyone has a personal crowd of individuals they can turn to for high-quality feedback. We introduce and evaluate Critiki, a novel system for gathering design critiques on crowdfunding project pages from paid crowdworkers. Stemming from previous research on crowdfunding project creators and their need for early-stage design feedback, we design and build a working system which fits the need of this population: rapid and inexpensive feedback. To solve issues with critique quality we describe a scaffolding technique designed to assist crowdworkers in writing high-quality critiques. We evaluate Critiki with two field deployments: 1) A randomized controlled experiment with 450 crowdworkers to evaluate the efficacy of the scaffolding technique and 2) A user study with 31 crowdfunding project creators to determine usability and user satisfaction. We contribute to research on Creativity and Cognition by demonstrating a working creativity support system, empirically evaluating the system, and describing how scaffolding approaches can be designed for other crowdsourced tasks",

    "abstract": "Collaborative idea generation leverages social interactions and knowledge sharing to spark diverse associations and produce creative ideas. Information exploration systems expand the current context by suggesting novel but related concepts. In this paper we introduce InspirationWall, an unobtrusive display that leverages speech recognition and information exploration to enhance an ongoing idea generation session with automatically retrieved concepts that relate to the conversation. We evaluated the system in six idea generation sessions of 20 minutes with small groups of two people. Preliminary results suggest that InspirationWall contrasts the decay of idea productivity over time and can thus represent an effective way to enhance idea generation activities.",

    "abstract": "When searching through collections of books or written texts, the efficient yet limiting query paradigm is still the most dominant entry point. Previous work characterizes search processes in various contexts and describes them as integral and closely related to creative endeavours. We revisit this work from a design perspective, proposing guidelines for versatile search interfaces that are based on a modular approach to search. Inspired by aspects of search in physical environments, our recommendations address learning, creativity, inspiration, and pleasure as positive aspects of (book) search. Based on in-depth interviews with library patrons about search practises in physical and digital environments and drawing from previous work on search behaviour, we discuss search patterns as modular constructs consisting of micro-strategies. We illustrate how the structure of these patterns is highly flexible. Much like creative processes, they fluidly evolve based on learning and ideation during search, particularly in physical environments. This modular perspective provides a basis for designing interfaces that facilitate creative approaches to search in digital environments.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the result of an empirical study of 32 adult dyads (i.e. groups of two people) engaged in pretend play. Our analysis indicates that participatory sense-making plays a key role in the success of pretend play sessions. We use the cognitive science theory of enaction as a theoretical lens to analyze the empirical data given its robust conceptual framework for describing participatory sense-making. We present here five enactive characteristics of pretend play that appear to be necessary and sufficient for the emergence and maintenance of successful pretend play _\u0084_ mental preparation, meaning building, narrative enaction, narrative deepening, and flow maintenance. This enactive formalization is used to propose a computational model of pretend play that can be used to design an agent capable of playing in real time with human users. ",

    "abstract": "We consider how the application of AI in digital musical instruments might maximally support exploration of sound in performance. Live performance applications of AI and machine learning have tended to focus on score following and the development of machine collaborators. In our work we are interested in exploring the development of systems whereby the human performer interacts with a reactive and creative agent in the creation of a single sonic output. The intention is to design systems that foster exploration and allow for greater (than with acoustic instruments) opportunities for serendipitous musical encounters. An initial approach to the integration of autonomous agency, based on gesture reshaping schemes within the Reactable performance system, is first outlined. We then describe a simple platform based on the non-player characters within Pacman, which serves as a test bed for guiding further discussion on what musical machine collaboration at this level may entail. Pilot studies for both systems are outlined.",

    "abstract": "As photography takes center stage on today's social media platforms, given the ease of modern capture devices (i.e. mobile phones, point and shoot cameras, tablets, etc.), the ability to produce and publish images occurs at a much quicker rate than the humble Kodak Brownie camera afforded the masses when introduced in January 1900. This enhanced ease has generated an opportunity for the everyday photographer to creatively communicate through the distribution of their images. This paper applies research results from a qualitative visual ethnographic study focusing on the non-verbal posts of a select group of Facebook users. The Dell Hymes' SPEAKING framework was used to structure the visual data\\; analysis leveraged Gerry Philipsen's Speech Codes Theory and James W. Carey's Ritual Communication Theory contributes to the creation of a communicative framework for the non-verbal social media postings. In conclusion, what emerges through the data is a visual speech code that tacitly leverages traditional photographic genres while at the same time supporting a system of meanings and symbols that enhance the instantaneous posts and communications of the day-to-day ebb and flow of life.",

Subsequent to the Slade, he completed his Ph.D. in a computer science department and, thereafter, worked as a lecturer and researcher in various university computer science departments. Up to 1992, his research focussed on the design and development of interactive systems for artists and designers and on how such systems are used.  During this period he undertook many funded design-focussed research projects (supported by grants in excess of \u00a32 million) almost all of which involved academic, commercial and industrial collaboration. He moved back into an art and design department in 1992, and since then his research has focussed on the theory and practice of what is often called practice-based research.",
