    "abstract": "Historically, the study of affect has been intimately tied to theories of both cognition and creativity, and there are still unexplored connections between these related phenomena. This paper discusses research to expand and refine the formulation of distributed affect as a theoretical framework for analyzing and understanding creative collaboration. I elaborate on parallels between theories of cognition that extend beyond the individual as the unit of analysis and the text-based chat communication of affect between members of a distributed group who utilize creative problem solving to achieve their goals. Directions for future research are also discussed. A better understanding of the way in which distributed affect operates will have a significant impact on research into collaborative creativity as well as implications for the design of interfaces to support this type of distributed work.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes three interactive artefacts created for a children_\u00e3_s exhibition intended to encourage creativity and allow educational opportunities to emerge naturally through playful exploration. We describe five sensibilities that were used to inform our designs: considering artefacts as resources and scaffolds for imaginative engagement, rewarding extended investment, facilitating requisite unpredictability, encouraging an imaginative orientation to participation, and permitting multiple loci for interaction. Based on observation of how our interactives were used by the public, we discuss how our approach facilitated _\u00e3\u00c4open interactions_\u00e3_ in a manner that was sensitive to the museum context, favoured a mix of materialities, and manifested a subtle mix of participation and designer autonomy.

It is the chosen tool of present-day craftspeople for creative expression in public. However, the personal narratives woven into the installations usually remain inaccessible for the broad audience. This paper presents my Master's thesis work on \"Tools for Wools\", an interactive prototype which integrates physical wool panels, touch sensors and an information device with intent to fill the identified information gap. The subsequent evaluation allowed insights on the manifold reasons for urban knitters to engage in this particular form of everyday creativity. I therefore suggest that such prototype projects can also serve as a qualitative research tool to reveal motivations underlying creative craft practices.",

Previous work characterizes search processes in various contexts and describes them as integral and closely related to creative endeavours. We revisit this work from a design perspective, proposing guidelines for versatile search interfaces that are based on a modular approach to search. Inspired by aspects of search in physical environments, our recommendations address learning, creativity, inspiration, and pleasure as positive aspects of (book) search. Based on in-depth interviews with library patrons about search practises in physical and digital environments and drawing from previous work on search behaviour, we discuss search patterns as modular constructs consisting of micro-strategies. We illustrate how the structure of these patterns is highly flexible. Much like creative processes, they fluidly evolve based on learning and ideation during search, particularly in physical environments. This modular perspective provides a basis for designing interfaces that facilitate creative approaches to search in digital environments.",

In our work we are interested in exploring the development of systems whereby the human performer interacts with a reactive and creative agent in the creation of a single sonic output. The intention is to design systems that foster exploration and allow for greater (than with acoustic instruments) opportunities for serendipitous musical encounters. An initial approach to the integration of autonomous agency, based on gesture reshaping schemes within the Reactable performance system, is first outlined. We then describe a simple platform based on the non-player characters within Pacman, which serves as a test bed for guiding further discussion on what musical machine collaboration at this level may entail.

    "abstract": "As photography takes center stage on today's social media platforms, given the ease of modern capture devices (i.e. mobile phones, point and shoot cameras, tablets, etc.), the ability to produce and publish images occurs at a much quicker rate than the humble Kodak Brownie camera afforded the masses when introduced in January 1900. This enhanced ease has generated an opportunity for the everyday photographer to creatively communicate through the distribution of their images. This paper applies research results from a qualitative visual ethnographic study focusing on the non-verbal posts of a select group of Facebook users. The Dell Hymes' SPEAKING framework was used to structure the visual data\\; analysis leveraged Gerry Philipsen's Speech Codes Theory and James W. Carey's Ritual Communication Theory contributes to the creation of a communicative framework for the non-verbal social media postings. In conclusion, what emerges through the data is a visual speech code that tacitly leverages traditional photographic genres while at the same time supporting a system of meanings and symbols that enhance the instantaneous posts and communications of the day-to-day ebb and flow of life.",

Our approach builds upon recent work in computational creativity called interactive machine learning (IML).

To apply IML to open-ended creative collaboration, we developed an enactive model of creativity (EMC) based upon the cognitive science theories of enaction. This paper introduces our enactive approach to building co-creative agents within the broader field of interactive machine learning by describing the theory, design, and initial prototypes of two co-creative agents.",

Different to other types of performance, theatre costumes are secondary to acting. Our investigations are based on two practice-based case studies: a self-directed design research within a student project, and a collaboration with a local theatre house, where interactive costume elements were developed in a real-life setting. These reveal requirements and challenges for the design process as well as the effective staging of interactive costumes, the biggest challenge being how to integrate these into existing structures of traditional theatre houses, and requirements for the costumes themselves. Because interactive costumes integrate technological features and traditional analogue crafts, they require interdisciplinary collaboration and transcend established boundaries between departments in theatre houses, challenging established work processes and structures.",

Since then design fiction has gained significant traction across academic contexts; at symposia and conference events; and through its practice within commercial design studios and industry. Despite becoming a popular way of framing speculative design, the characterisation of design fiction as research approach still remains _\u00d1\u00d2up for grabs_\u00d1\u009d [19:22] as it is _\u00d1\u00d2enticing and provocative, yet [_\u00d1_] remains elusive_\u00d1\u009d [7:1].

Drawing on ethnographic research focusing on participation in creative activities for people with dementia living in care, the paper details how residents engaged with technologies (such as television) in a passive way (spending hours sitting in front of the TV without engaging with others around them), and in an active way (singing and dancing to music played via stereo and record player). Findings from this research emphasise the importance for interaction design for dementia in appreciating the role of active creative participation in sustaining personhood in dementia. Given a lack of both time and resources in publicly-funded care homes, we also highlight the value of opportunistic design in the field.",

The pervasive experience used a iPad-based virtual narrator to guide groups of participants around a physical and digital environment. It took place towards the start of a three-day workshop and the playful, self-directed nature of the experience was designed to align with subsequent workshop activities. This paper describes the user experience, presenting observations and findings through the lens of space (facilitation, augmentation and story), considering how the experience related to and supported the overall workshop aims of ideation and creative thinking.

How to design an interactive system that can effectively make use of this potential is, however, still an unanswered question. In this paper, we propose one approach to this problem that relies on hacking into the cognitive appraisal processes that form part of positive emotions. To demonstrate our approach we have conceived, made, and evaluated a novel interactive system that influences an individual_\u00e3_s appraisals of their own idea generation processes by providing real-time and believable feedback about the originality of their ideas. The system can be used to manipulate this feedback to make the user_\u00e3_s ideas appear more or less original. This has enabled us to test experimentally the hypothesis that providing more positive feedback, rather than neutral, or more negative feedback than the user is expecting, causes more positive emotion, which in turn causes more creativity during idea generation. The findings demonstrate that an interactive system can be designed to use the function of cognitive appraisal processes in positive emotion to help people to get more out of their own creative capabilities.",

However due to the wide range of tools and interfaces, a common static file format called STL is used for sharing designs. While customization tools add creative handles to these digital models, they are often constrained to pre-configured parameters limiting the creative potential of shared digital models. We introduce MetaMorphe, a novel digital fabrication framework that uses a common web-programming metaphor to enable users to easily transform static 3D models into re-formed, re-made, and re-imagined customized personal artifacts. We demonstrate the compatibility of MetaMorphe with three well-established design interfaces, direction manipulation, scripted-CAD, and generative design. Through a user study with design experts, MetaMorphe reveals that decisions that physically produce bespoke artifacts or encode unique metadata actively affect perceptions of authorship, agency, and authenticity. We discuss how expressive model-building tools such as MetaMorphe enable a cultural shift in 3D design in terms of participation, personalization, and creativity.",

The typical approach is to have a panel of experts answer likert questions about individual artifacts. This process typically requires a substantial amount of training to ensure the judges achieve an acceptable level of agreement. Consequently, the approach does not scale well as it is infeasible to have a panel of experts regularly evaluate the creativity of a large number of designs. The current work explores an alternative approach that uses both individual and pairwise judgements from novice crowd workers to support reliable and scalable assessment of creative designs. This approach, which we call TrueCreativity, can operate over a set of evaluations from a large number of judges and appropriately weights their evaluations based on their past reliability and agreement with other judges.  We show that this approach produces results that strongly correlate with another measure of creativity. ",

In this paper, we present the results of an empirical investigation regarding the effect of space and tool availability on user experience and creativity. The goal is to understand whether and how space and tool availability allow users to be more creative and improve their overall experience. To do so, we developed a connect-the-dots drawing multi-user application with a focus on having certain restrictions in size and specific tool availability. Based on this application, we conducted an empirical study with 38 users. For the evaluation, surveys, photos and observations were recorded and used in our analysis. The results showed that: (a) tool availability does not affect user creativity and experience and (b) space availability affects user creativity, collaboration and hedonic motivation (pleasure). Although our results are early, provide insights that tools_\u00d1\u00e9 limitation does not hinder users_\u00d1\u00e9 ability to be creative; and space availability is of great importance in creative activities.",

By designing online tools and platforms that encourage and scaffold that act of help-seeking, we can connect more designers with informal mentors who can help them improve and implement their work as a professional product.

These verbalizations are segmented in order to enable a quantifiable analysis of the cognitive processes. Researchers have shown how Shannon_\u00d1\u00e9s entropy can be applied to coded verbal data to provide a measure of creativity of those processes. We applied this method to a pilot study, investigating the effects of different design tools on creativity in the context of architectural design. Participants had to design three tasks of isomorphic nature, each with a different tool, in one design session. As shown a significant number of verbal comments were repetitions of already established ideas. Such comments brought nothing new to the sequence of activities but affected the value of information carried within that process which biased the measure of creativity. The paper regards these utterance as verbal noise. It proposes the use of corpus linguistic tools together with a coding scheme that can depict the hierarchical relationship of cognitive patterns used in the process to eliminate verbal noise from analysis. The method was applied to one participant_\u00d1\u00e9s data, which shows a promising step in increasing the veracity of using verbal data in analyzing cognitive activity. ",

It provides asynchronous and synchronous facilities for multi-user interaction while leveraging creativity with computational tools for inspirational search, inspirational clue generation and problem solving advice. Initial evaluation with a small group of users indicated that the software is in-line with the creative research approach where users work together with concept developers taking on multiple roles throughout the design process.",

    "abstract": "We extend the Twitter interface to stimulate exploratory browsing of social media and develop a creative cognition method to establish its efficacy. Exploratory browsing is a creative process in which users seek and traverse diverse and novel information as they investigate a conceptual space. The TweetBubble browser extension extends Twitter  to enable expansion of  social media associations_\u00e3\u0094@usernames and #hashtags_\u00e3\u0094in-context, without overwriting initial content. We build on a prior metadata type system, developing new presentation semantics, which enable an integrated look and feel consistent with Twitter. \\  \\ We show how exploratory browsing constitutes a mini-c creative process. We use prior ideation metrics as a basis for new ideation metrics of exploratory browsing. We conducted a mixed methods crowdsourced study, with data from 54 participants, amidst the 2014 Academy Awards. Quantitative and qualitative findings validate the technique of in-context exploratory browsing interfaces for social media. Their consistency supports the validity of ideation metrics of exploratory browsing as an evaluation methodology for interactive systems designed to promote creative engagement.",

    "abstract": "Emerging online ideation platforms with thousands of example ideas provide an important resource for creative production. But how can ideators best use these examples to create new innovations? Recent work has suggested that not just the choice of examples, but also the timing of their delivery can impact creative outcomes. Building on existing cognitive theories of creative insight, we hypothesize that people are likely to benefit from examples when they run out of ideas. We explore two example delivery mechanisms that test this hypothesis: 1) a system that proactively provides examples when a user appears to have run out of ideas, and 2) a system that provides examples when a user explicitly requests them. Our online experiment (N=97) compared these two mechanisms against two baselines: providing no examples and automatically showing examples at a regular interval. Participants who requested examples themselves generated ideas that were rated the most novel by external evaluators. Participants who received ideas automatically when they appeared to be stuck produced the most ideas. Importantly, participants who received examples at a regular interval generated fewer ideas than participants who received no examples, suggesting that mere access to examples is not sufficient for creative inspiration. These results emphasize the importance of the timing of  example delivery. Insights from this study can inform the design of collective ideation support systems that help people generate many high quality ideas.",

The central hypothesis is that for both kinds of textiles, there will be differences depending on whether the study participants experience the textiles via vision alone or via both vision and touch.  \\  \\ If designers could begin to understand the nature of what various textile expressions communicated, and what computational textiles communicated in transformation then it would be possible to more clearly understand the role that texture of a computational textile plays in communicating emotion through a computational object. \\  \\  \\ ",

    "abstract": "Secondhand retail in the UK charity sector plays a number of important social and economic roles: charity shops are community focal points; money is generated for good causes; and goods are re-circulated that might otherwise be discarded as abject and unwanted. However, like much of the UK high street, the prosperity of charity shops is under significant threat from the rise of internet shopping. Access to online markets via smart phones equips customers to check prices for secondhand items, some customers then deploy information, usually from eBay, to haggle with shop staff. The Haggle-o-Tron playfully subverts both normative and emerging secondhand retail valuation practices by revealing secondhand goods_\u00e3_ financial, moral, social and aesthetic properties. This paper reports on how we employ vibrant yet uncomplicated design interventions that embed the charity's values and ethos to reconfigure store-based economic transactions. ",

We introduce and evaluate Critiki, a novel system for gathering design critiques on crowdfunding project pages from paid crowdworkers. Stemming from previous research on crowdfunding project creators and their need for early-stage design feedback, we design and build a working system which fits the need of this population: rapid and inexpensive feedback. To solve issues with critique quality we describe a scaffolding technique designed to assist crowdworkers in writing high-quality critiques. We evaluate Critiki with two field deployments: 1) A randomized controlled experiment with 450 crowdworkers to evaluate the efficacy of the scaffolding technique and 2) A user study with 31 crowdfunding project creators to determine usability and user satisfaction. We contribute to research on Creativity and Cognition by demonstrating a working creativity support system, empirically evaluating the system, and describing how scaffolding approaches can be designed for other crowdsourced tasks",
