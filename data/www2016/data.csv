In this tutorial, we survey the different definitions of centrality measures and the algorithms to compute them. We start from the most common measures (e.g., closeness centrality, betweenness centrality) and move to more complex ones, like spanning-edge centrality. In our presentation, we begin from exact algorithms and then move to approximation algorithms, including sampling-based ones, and to highly-scalable MapReduce algorithms for huge graphs, both for exact computation and for keeping the measures up-to-date on dynamic graphs where edges are inserted or deleted over time. Our goal is to show how advanced algorithmic techniques and scalable systems can be used to obtain efficient algorithms for important graph mining tasks, and to encourage research in the area by highlighting open problems and possible directions.

It also is a good reference to discuss the underlying block chain mechanics which are the foundation of various altcoins (e.g. Namecoin) and other derived systems. In this tutorial, the topic of cryptographic currencies is solely addressed from a technical IT security point-of-view. Therefore we do not cover any legal, sociological, financial and economical aspects. The tutorial is designed for participants with a solid IT security background but will not assume any prior knowledge on cryptographic currencies.

Given a large collection of time series, such as web-click logs, online search queries, blog and review entries, how can we efficiently and effectively find typical time-series patterns? What are the major tools for mining, forecasting and outlier detection? Time-series data analysis is becoming of increasingly high importance, thanks to the decreasing cost of hardware and the increasing on-line processing capability. The objective of this tutorial is to provide a concise and intuitive overview of the most important tools that can help us find meaningful patterns in large-scale time-series data. Specifically we review the state of the art in three related fields: (1) similarity search, pattern discovery and summarization, (2) non-linear modeling and forecasting, and (3) the extension of time-series mining and tensor analysis. We also introduce case studies that illustrate their practical use for social media and Web-based services."T,2006,Automatic Entity Recognition And Typing in Massive Text Corpora,"Xiang Ren, Ahmed El-Kishky, Chi Wang And Jiawei Han",Tuesday,9:00 - 12:30,9:00 - 12:30,Automatic Entity Recognition And Typing in Massive Text Corpora,,521ABC,,"In today's computerized and information-based society, we are soaked with vast amounts of natural language text data, ranging from news articles, product reviews, advertisements, to a wide range of user-generated content from social media. To turn such massive unstructured text data into actionable knowledge, one of the grand challenges is to gain an understanding of entities and the relationships between them. In this tutorial, we introduce data-driven methods to recognize typed entities of interest in different kinds of text corpora (especially in massive, domain-specific text corpora). These methods can automatically identify token spans as entity mentions in text and label their types (e.g., people, product, organization) in a scalable way. We demonstrate on real datasets including news articles and yelp reviews how these typed entities aid in knowledge discovery and management."T,2007,Building Decentralized Applications For The Social Web,"Andrei Sambra, Amy Guy, Sarven Capadisli And Nicola Greco",Tuesday,14:00 -17:30,14:00 -17:30,Building Decentralized Applications For The Social Web,,519A,,"Recent advancements in technologies and protocols mean that it is easier than ever to integrate social features into diverse web applications, and increased awareness of privacy concerns means that it is pertinent to consider empowerment of application users when doing so.

A prime example for that is the navigation of users between websites enabled through the presence of hyperlinks. How- ever, today, we can think of many other kinds of transitional behavior that many of us perform on a daily base. For instance, if users listen to music on Spotify, they transition between songs, or when users check-in at locations on Foursquare they transition between geocoordinates, or when users write reviews on Amazon they transition between products. To that end, we consider all kinds of transitions between states as sequences on the Web. States can refer to any kind of categorical action per- formed, such as the ones listed. Our research community has been interested in studying such sequences in various contexts such as (i) modeling, (ii) the detection of regularities and patterns or (iii) the understanding of the production of underlying sequences (e.g., cognitive strategies). Recent research heavily focused on studying human navigation on the Web, but also other types of transition data have sparked the interest of researchers such as mobility sequences, search sequences or song listening sequences. In this tutorial we will give an outline of the fundamental methods of analyzing such categorical sequences on the Web and discuss some recent advancements in-depth."W,2009,#MICROPOST2016 - The 6th 'Making Sense Of Microposts' Workshop,"Aba-Sah Dadzie, Amparo E.
