Originally, the other years saw the meetings of the ECAI, AAAI, and a Pacific conference, but currently the AAAI conference runs every year. When it is held in North America it is hosted by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence and traditionally replaces the AAAI conference. IJCAI is a highly selective conference. For instance, only 20% of the papers submitted to the conference were accepted in 2005. This makes it a more selective publication than many AI journals.",
