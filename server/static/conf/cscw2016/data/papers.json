    "abstract": "The physical workplace _ a hub for communication, collaboration and co-located interaction _ can no longer be taken for granted. Today, the design of intelligent interactive media, physical products and ubiquitous environments has passed the phase of being technology-driven. Meaning, insight and experience are now the key design drivers for the bridging of digital and physical design. We foresee how new interconnected knowledge systems _ objects/devices, buildings and even cities created from web-based services and IoT _ thoroughly transform CSCW. A wide spectrum of services already invites users to seamlessly move between real and virtual workspaces, using a range of previously separated media channels. This interdisciplinary workshop welcomes researchers and practitioners to a day-long exchange targeting User eXperience (UX) and, specifically, the relationship between social and spatial connectedness in mediated and virtual work environments. Examples from ongoing research and developments informs a discussion on how the borders between the virtual and real become increasingly obsolete.",

    "abstract": "There are new potentials for transformative developments in government, work life, science, and emergency response as the use of participatory and social media has become widespread in society and enabled a more collaborative information production. However, these new platforms for participation have not solved many of the pre-crowd problems regarding participation, such as lack of representativeness and flawed deliberative processes. Therefore it is important and relevant to look at the power relations within crowd production and to examine how different tools handle participatory processes in the crowd. This workshop examines different types of participation in crowd work such as crowdsourced policymaking, crisis management, citizen science and paid crowd work, among others, focusing on relations and power dynamics within and beyond the crowds. We welcome researchers from a diversity of disciplines and perspectives to formulate a typology of participation in crowd work. ",

    "abstract": "As the world becomes more digitized and interconnected, information that was once considered to be private such as one's health status is now being shared publicly. To understand this new phenomenon better, it is crucial to study what types of health information are being shared on social media and why, as well as by whom. In this paper, we study the traits of users who share their personal health and fitness related information on social media by analyzing fitness status updates that MyFitnessPal users have shared via Twitter. We investigate how certain features like user profile, fitness activity, and fitness network in social media can potentially impact the long-term engagement of fitness app users. We also discuss implications of our findings to achieve a better retention of these users and to promote more sharing of their status updates.",

    "abstract": "Attending and presenting at conferences is a core part of academic and industrial research. Yet it can sometimes be challenging to attend conferences due to travel restrictions, time limitations, or accessibility challenges. To understand how people may be able to attend conferences remotely, we explored the use of commercial telepresence robots called Beams at Ubicomp/ISWC 2014. Seven people attended the conference remotely and used Beams to attend presentations, ask questions, and participate in break mingling activities. We collected data of their activities and conducted an online survey with the broader set of conference attendees. Results show that telepresence robots supported attendance at a basic level and even empowered those with accessibility challenges. However, issues related to identity, interaction, navigation, and privacy emerged. We present recommendations for future telepresence attendance at conferences focused on balancing these concerns with the benefits participants received.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decades the advances in pervasive technology have enabled new ways of understanding human behaviour in the workplace. This trend merged with the new rise in the Quantified-Self movement has engendered a new paradigm of Quantified Workplace, where sensing solutions as well as participatory inputs could be used to model, quantify and visualise dynamics of the workplace. In this workshop we want to start a new dialogue to discuss challenges, insights and reflections on this topic. To this aim we are looking for original submissions which offer new insights or propose new techniques for Quantified Workplace.

    "abstract": "Parents, educators, and policymakers have expressed concern about the future implications of young people's sharing practices on social media sites. However, little is known about how young people themselves feel about their online behaviors being preserved and resurfaced later in adulthood. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 28 college-going, primarily female, young adults about their use of social media and their transition from adolescence into young adulthood. We find that participants recognize archival value in their own Facebook histories, despite sometimes perceiving these histories to be embarrassing. They experience tensions between meeting their current self-presentational goals and maintaining the authenticity of historical content. To reconcile these tensions, they engage in retrospective impression management practices, such as curating past content. They also engage in \"backstalking\" behaviors, in which they view and engage with other users' Facebook histories openly with close ties and discreetly with weak ties. We consider this ludic engagement through the lens of emerging adulthood and discuss the theoretical implications of our findings, especially in light of emerging applications which intentionally resurface digital traces.",

These efforts - in China, the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere _ aim to affect societal changes through technical means. Yet, these projects are seldom only computational, but often a combination of technical and social, interwoven to provide a suitable infrastructure for these efforts to change society. These projects are seldom only collaborative either, but collaboration and coordination play central roles in many of these efforts. CSCW cannot only learn from these efforts in the field but CSCW\u00cds research interests and findings can also help in return.

    "abstract": "Past research suggests that many individuals take Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) for employment-related reasons. It is unclear, however, how learners leverage MOOCs for employment and how effectively these platforms support employability. To explore this further, we surveyed 441 learners and interviewed 22 learners motivated to take MOOCs for reasons related to financial limitations and/or reasons related to employment. Using the three dimensions of employability as a framework human and social capital, career identity, and personal adaptability we find that while most of our participants were optimistic about the potential for MOOCs to improve their employability, there was very limited tangible evidence of employment mobility from taking MOOCs. Though MOOCs support human capital, there are opportunities to further support social capital, career identity, and personal adaptability. We contribute a deeper understanding of learners who use MOOCs for employment and provide concrete design implications for MOOC platforms to better support employability in the future. We found very few low SES learners using MOOCs for reasons of employment and identify opportunities for MOOCs to reach and support these learners. ",

    "abstract": "Relationship breakdowns are undoubtedly difficult. Access to and use of technology can exacerbate the situation. In our networked society, shared lives generate vast amounts of shared digital data which can be difficult to untangle, whilst social media can provide an outlet to emotions that can take a public and often persistent form. In this paper, we report on a qualitative study that considered the role of technology in the process of a relationship breaking down. Four main themes emerged in our findings: communicating about the separation, change in social status, shared digital assets, and moving on. Opportunities for design are identified in reducing misunderstandings via CMCs, enhancing social media, supporting intimacy in distributed families, and refining service provision.",

    "abstract": "The study and analysis of large and complex data sets offer a wealth of insights in a variety of applications. Computational approaches provide researchers access to broad assemblages of data, but the insights extracted may lack the rich detail that qualitative approaches have brought to the understanding of sociotechnical phenomena. How do we preserve the richness associated with traditional qualitative methods while utilizing the power of large data sets? How do we uncover social nuances or consider ethics and values in data use? These and other questions are explored by human-centered data science, an emerging field at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI), computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), human computation, and the statistical and computational techniques of data science. This workshop, the first of its kind at CSCW, seeks to bring together researchers interested in human-centered approaches to data science to collaborate, define a research agenda, and form a community.

    "abstract": "Research on newcomer roles in peer production sites (e.g., Wikipedia) is characterized by a broad and relatively well articulated set of functionally and culturally recognizable roles. But not all communities come with well-defined roles that newcomers can aspire to occupy. The present study explores activity clusters newcomers create when faced with few recognizable roles to fill and limited access to other participants'  work that serves as an exemplar. Drawing on a mixed method research design, we present findings from an analysis of 1,687 newcomers' sessions in an online citizen science project. Our analysis revealed three major findings: (1) newcomers' activities exists across six session types; (2) newcomers toggle between light work sessions and more involved types of production or community engagement; (3) high-level contributors contribute large volumes of work but comment very little and another group contributes large volumes of comments, but works very little. The former group draws heavily on posts contributed by the latter group. Identifying shifts and regularities in contribution facilitate improved mechanisms for engaging participants and for the design of online citizen science communities.",

    "abstract": "Patient-generated data is increasingly common in chronic disease care management. Smartphone applications and wearable sensors help patients more easily collect health information. However, current commercial tools often do not effectively support patients and providers in collaboration surrounding these data. This paper examines patient expectations and current collaboration practices around patient-generated data. We survey 211 patients, interview 18 patients, and re-analyze a dataset of 21 provider interviews. We find that collaboration occurs in every stage of self- tracking and that patients and providers create boundary negotiating artifacts to support the collaboration. Building upon current practices with patient-generated data, we use these theories of patient and provider collaboration to analyze misunderstandings and privacy concerns as well as identify opportunities to better support these collaborations. We reflect on the social nature of patient-provider collaboration to suggest future development of the stage- based model of personal informatics and the theory of boundary negotiating artifacts.",

    "abstract": "The number of stay-at-home dads (SAHDs) in the U.S. has risen dramatically over the past 30 years. Despite gaining social acceptability, SAHDs still experience isolation and judgment in their offline environments. This research explores how SAHDs use the Internet and social media related to their roles as fathers. We conducted interviews with 18 SAHDs about their families, their identities, and their social experiences. We find that they turn to social media to gain social support and overcome isolation they experience offline. However, they engage in strategic self-disclosure on particular platforms to avoid judgment related to being SAHDs. They rely on online platforms to give off both traditionally feminine and masculine impressions as loving caregivers of their children while simultaneously as do-it-yourself men who make things around the house. Through creating Facebook groups and using anonymous social media sites, SAHDs create multidimensional social networks that allow them to cope better with the role change. We reflect on the evolving roles of SAHDs in society, and put forth an argument for greater support for diverse kinds of parenting online.",

    "abstract": "Extensive scholarship has investigated technology use among families. Existing work has focused primarily on parents' reactions to and restrictions of their children's technology use; here, we explore the underlying tensions surrounding technology use in the home. We draw on historical perspectives of adolescence and family life to better understand technology's impact on present-day parents and teens. Through an interview study with 18 parent-child pairs (19 parents; 23 children, ages 10-17), we find a number of technology tensions, including 1) parents' underestimation of children's technology use; 2) children's perception that parents only tell them which behaviors to avoid; 3) both parents' and children's poor adherence to household technology rules; and 4) parents' and children's desire for mutual attention. We argue that the use of personal devices introduces distinctive challenges into modern family life, due to the limited visibility (or practical obscurity) of personal device use, expectations of constant connectivity, and overly-romanticized notions of family time. We consider the historical evolution of both teenage and family life, and conclude that consistent and realistic expectations around work, attention, and adolescence may help families better manage household technology use.",

However, the potential benefits of using computer supported collaboration to encourage social interactions between individuals with autism and typically developed individuals are underexplored, particularly in developing regions.

The application encourages joint attention, which is defined as the shared attention between two individuals towards the same object. Using mixed methods, we evaluated Balloons for three weeks in New Delhi with ten medium-low functioning autistic children.

We found that licensing terms vary in unpredictable ways, and that user expectations and opinions differ by license and by type of website. Moreover, the most undesirable terms, such as right to modify, appear more frequently than users expect. We argue that users care about how their content can be used yet lack critical information.

    "abstract": "When users post on social network sites, they can engage in audience-reaching strategies, in an effort to reach desired audience members, as well as audience-limiting strategies, in an effort to avoid unwanted audience members. While much research has focused on users' audience-limiting strategies, little research has explicitly focused on users' audience-reaching strategies. Additionally, little work has explored either strategy at the post level. Using mixed methods involving a diary study and follow-up interviews focused on a diverse group of users' posts, this article reveals several audience-reaching strategies users engaged from altering their content to tagging. However, users in this study rarely used strategies to exclude people proactively and technologically outside of their targeted audiences, and instead broadcasted widely. Participants described several rationales for sharing broadly from skill-related issues to a reliance on the audience or site to filter the content.",

    "abstract": "Young people worldwide are participating in ever-increasing numbers in online fan communities. Far from mere shallow repositories of pop culture, these sites are accumulating significant evidence that sophisticated informal learning is taking place online in novel and unexpected ways. In order to understand and analyze in more detail how learning might be occurring, we conducted an in-depth nine-month ethnographic investigation of online fanfiction communities, including participant observation and fanfiction author interviews. Our observations led to the development of a theory we term distributed mentoring, which we present in detail in this paper. Distributed mentoring exemplifies one instance of how networked technology affords new extensions of behaviors that were previously bounded by time and space. Distributed mentoring holds potential for application beyond the spontaneous mentoring observed in this investigation and may help students receive diverse, thoughtful feedback in formal learning environments as well.",

    "abstract": "Virtual teams have become a ubiquitous form of organizing, but the impact of social structures within and between teams on group performance remains understudied. This paper uses the case study of a massively multiplayer online game and server log data from over 10,000 players to examine the connection between group social capital (operationalized through guild network structure measures) and team effectiveness, given a variety of in-game social networks. Three different networks, social, task, and exchange networks, are compared and contrasted while controlling for group size, group age, and player experience. Team effectiveness is maximized at a roughly moderate level of closure across the networks, suggesting that this is the optimal level of the group's network density. Guilds with high brokerage, meaning they have diverse connections with other groups, were more effective in achievement-oriented networks. In addition, guilds with central leaders were more effective when they teamed up with other guild leaders.",

The goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together researchers with diverse, yet convergent interests in tabletop, surface, mobile and wearable technologies, and those interested in the social aspects of interaction, such as conversation analysis and ethnomethodology. These communities have matured considerably, and produced significant exemplars of systems, methods, and studies concerned with collocated interactions. Yet, new challenges abound as people wear and carry more devices than ever, creating fragmented device ecologies at work, and changing the ways we socialise with each other. In this workshop we seek to start a dialogue to look back as well as forward, review best practices, discuss and design paper-prototypes using the collocated design framework, to consider how we might address new and future challenges through collocated design practice.

    "abstract": "Designing effective incentives is a challenge across many social computing contexts, from attracting crowdworkers to sustaining online contributions. However, one aspect of incentivizing that has been understudied is its impact on participation bias, as different incentives may attract different subsets of the population to participate. In this paper, we present two empirical studies in the crowdworking context that show that the incentive offered influence who participates in the task. Using the Basic Human Values, we found that a lottery reward attracted participants who held stronger openness-to-change values while a charity reward attracted those with stronger self-transcendence orientation. Further, we found that participation self-selection resulted in differences in the task outcomes. Through attracting more self-directed individuals, the lottery reward resulted in more ideas generated in a brainstorming task. Design implications include utilizing rewards to target desired participants and using diverse incentives to improve participation diversity.  ",

Families develop 'systems' or methods through which they coordinate and manage their everyday financial activities. Through an analysis of our fieldwork data collected from fifteen families, we provide several examples of such systems, highlighting their qualities and illustrating how such systems come to support the handling of financial activities in the home. Our results show that these systems are developed with a careful consideration of familial values, relationships and routines; and incorporate the use of physical and digital tools. Consequently, we suggest that design should consider the use and non-use of technology when supporting household financial management, taking into account the richness of families' existing organically formed practices surrounding financial systems. Finally, our findings point to the fact that financial management in the domestic setting is socially organized and is closely connected to supporting everyday household activities.",

Findings of our study include the following: (1) the horizontal and vertical display angles have a higher honeypot effect, i.e., people interacting with a display attract other people, than the tilted display angle, (2) the vertical display angle, compared to the horizontal and tilted display angles, attracts several people to the display and encourages them to stay in the display space and share the space for a short period of time (88 seconds on average), and as a result, people frequently enter and leave the space with a display, and (3) display angles closer to the horizontal promotes the side-by-side arrangement, and display angles closer to the vertical promotes the L-shaped arrangement of F-formation.

The initial project experience of contributors plays an important role in this, particularly when the contribution process requires some degree of expertise. We propose three analytical dimensions to assess first-time contributor engagement based on readily available public data: cohort analysis, task analysis, and observation of contributor performance. We apply these to a large-scale study of remote mapping activities coordinated by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, a global volunteer effort with thousands of contributors. Our study shows that different coordination practices can have a marked impact on contributor retention, and that complex task designs can be a deterrent for certain contributor groups.

    "abstract": "Parents and children both use technology actively and increasingly, but prior work shows that concerns about attention, family time, and family relationships abound. We conducted a survey with 249 parent-child pairs distributed across 40 U.S. states to understand the types of technology rules (also known as restrictive mediation) they have established in their family and how effective those rules are perceived to be. Our data robustly show that children (age 10-17) are more likely to follow rules that constrain technology activities (e.g., no Snapchat) than rules that constrain technology use in certain contexts (e.g., no phone at the dinner table). Children find context constraints harder to live up to, parents find them harder to enforce, and parents' most common challenge when trying to enforce such rules is that children \"\u00d2can't put it down.\"\u009d This is consistent with the idea that banning certain technologies is currently easier than setting more nuanced boundaries. Parents and children agree that parents should also unplug when spending time with family, while children alone express frustration with the common parent practice of posting about children online. Together, our results suggest several mechanisms by which designers and families can improve parent-child relationships around technology use.",

We present results from a scenario-based online survey study on American and Chinese Internet users' privacy preferences of OBA. Since privacy is context-dependent, we investigated the effects of country (US vs. China), activity (e.g., online shopping vs. online banking), and platform (desktop/laptop vs. mobile app) on people's willingness to share their information for OBA. We found that American respondents were significantly less willing to share their data and had more specific concerns than their Chinese counterparts. We situate these differences in the broader historical, legal, and social scenes of these countries. We also found that respondents' OBA preferences varied significantly across different online activities, suggesting the potential of context-aware privacy tools for OBA. However, we did not find a significant effect of platform on people's OBA preferences. Lastly, we discuss design implications for privacy tools.",

    "abstract": "Unlike most social media, where automatic archiving of data is the default, Snapchat defaults to ephemerality: deleting content shortly after it is viewed by a receiver. Interviews with 25 Snapchat users show that ephemerality plays a key role in shaping their practices. Along with friend-adding features that facilitate a network of mostly close relations, default deletion affords everyday, mundane talk and reduces self-consciousness while encouraging playful interaction. Further, although receivers can save content through screenshots, senders are notified; this selective saving with notification supports complex information norms that preserve the feel of ephemeral communication while supporting the capture of meaningful content. This dance of giving and taking, sharing and showing, and agency for both senders and receivers provides the basis for a rich design space of mechanisms, levels, and domains for ephemerality.",

    "abstract": "While the web contains many social websites, people are generally left in the dark about the activities of other people traversing the web as a whole. In this paper, we explore the potential benefits and privacy considerations around generating a real-time, publicly accessible stream of web activity where users can publish chosen parts of their web browsing data. Taking inspiration from social media systems, we describe individual benefits that can be unlocked by such sharing and that may incentivize users to publish aspects of their browsing. We ask whether and how these benefits outweigh potential costs in lost privacy.   We conduct our study of public web activity sharing through scenario-based interviews and a field deployment of a tool for web activity sharing.",

    "abstract": "In online collaboration projects, conflicts often arise in the peer review process, due to the disagreement over whether one's contribution should be accepted. These conflicts generally have detrimental effects on contributors' continuing participation in the community. Few studies have investigated how to manage these conflicts effectively. This paper aims to examine the effectiveness of three strategies \"\u00d0 rational explanation, constructive suggestion, and social encouragement \"\u00d0 in managing conflicts.  In an analysis of 170 online software development projects, we investigated how different conflict management strategies aimed at handling contributors' arguments during the peer review process influenced their subsequent participation in the projects. The results show that (i) conflicts significantly increase contributors' likelihood of leaving the communities; (ii) neither rational explanations nor social encouragement could reduce the negative consequences of conflicts; (iii) only constructive suggestions have a positive effect in retaining the contributors.

    "abstract": "New multi-modal annotation tools hold the promise of bringing the benefits of face-to-face contact to remote, asynchronous interactions. One such system, RichReview++, incorporates new techniques to improve access to the embedded multimedia commentary and allows users to annotate with new modalities, like deictic gestures.  We conducted a series of field deployments of RichReview++ to characterize how these features benefit students using them for activities in the university classroom. Our first deployment investigated the use of multi-modal annotations as a way for instructors to provide feedback on student term papers. Our second deployment used annotations to support peer discussion about assigned readings in a graduate-level course. We found that presenting voice comments as interactive waveforms seems to facilitate students' consumption of the instructor's voice comments. We also found that gestural annotations clarify voice and give annotators a quick and lightweight way to alter the scope of their voice comments. Based on these results, we suggest ways to best leverage multi-modal annotation tools in education environments.",

    "abstract": "Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Systems are considered crucial for diagnosis, treatment and care of patients. However, practical benefits of such systems have been far below expectations. This paper explores how the evolving interdependencies in organizational, clinical, political, and behavioral terms influence the design and implementation of CDS. The paper discusses how these interdependencies complicate clinical use of CDS where cross-departmental patient pathways increasingly dominate approaches to dealing with patients with complex conditions.   Empirically, we report from an acute geriatric patient pathway project. The aim was to design and implement a decision-support form for triage of elderly patients in the emergency unit. The study emphasizes the intertwined collaborative nature of healthcare work, and the resulting need to consider the whole context when designing and implementing CDS tools. The contribution is to emphasize the \"extended design\" perspective to capture how workplace technologies and practices are shaped across multiple contexts and prolonged periods.   ",

    "abstract": "Expert feedback is valuable but hard to obtain for many designers. Online crowds can provide fast and affordable feedback, but workers may lack relevant domain knowledge and experience. Can expert rubrics address this issue and help novices provide expert-level feedback? To evaluate this, we conducted an experiment with a 2x2 factorial design. Student designers received feedback on a visual design from both experts and novices, who produced feedback using either an expert rubric or no rubric. We found that rubrics helped novice workers provide feedback that was rated nearly as valuable as expert feedback. A follow-up analysis on writing style showed that student designers found feedback most helpful when it was emotionally positive and specific, and that a rubric increased the occurrence of these characteristics in feedback. The analysis also found that expertise correlated with longer critiques, but not the other favorable characteristics. An informal evaluation indicates that experts may instead have produced value by providing clearer justifications.",

We present a study of 3 million food related posts shared on Instagram, and observe that content from food deserts indicate consumption of food high in fat, cholesterol and sugar; a rate higher by 5-17% compared to non-food desert areas. Further, a topic model analysis reveals the ingestion language of food deserts to bear distinct attributes. Finally, we investigate to what extent Instagram ingestion language is able to infer whether a tract is a food desert. We find that a predictive model that uses ingestion topics, socio- economic and food deprivation status attributes yields high accuracy (>80%) and improves over baseline methods by 6-14%. We discuss the role of social media in helping address inequalities in food access and health.",

We found that asking increases tags provided overall, though asking generally decreases the provision of unprompted tags. Users were more likely to comply with our request when we asked them to tag obscure movies and when we used reciprocal request rhetoric.",

Teams must not only share a variety of materials related to the work in real time, but also need to refer back to information after a meeting ends. While video tools make it relatively easy to have conversations at a distance, they are less adept at sharing and archiving multimedia content.  We conducted a survey of and interviews with members of distributed teams to investigate how they create, use, and share multimedia content before, during, and after distributed meetings. Our findings shed light on decisions made and rationales used in selecting technologies to prepare for, conduct, and archive the results of a video-mediated distributed meeting.  The results suggest a need for flexible interfaces for information sharing in multiple meeting contexts so content can be both easily referred to in the moment and also found again later.",

This paper investigates how social media experiences and interactions can support college-focused identity construction for low-income, first-generation college students. Drawing on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 31 emergent adults from disadvantaged backgrounds in the United States, we identify social media affordances that support the process of identity work during a critical transition period. Findings indicate that social media platforms support provisional identity work, but disadvantaged college students lack access to mentor-like figures that could be accessible through social media. We also find barriers to sharing information online that may extend to other life transitions in multiple life contexts and review the design implications of our findings. ",

This theoretical framing reveals the ways in which privacy is cooperatively negotiated, which is in contrast to the individualistic view of existing sharing systems; how older adults derive benefits from sharing depending on interaction with their audience; and how sharing fluctuates between a focus on the process of therapy versus the product depending on privacy needs.

Using a data set of 37,515 revisions from 16,616 unique editors to 96 Wikipedia articles as a case study, we analyze the prevalence and significance of different sequences of editing patterns. We illustrate the mixed method potential of sequence approaches by interpreting the frequent patterns as general classes of behavioral motifs.

We pre-sent the first large-scale quantitative study investigating pro-ED communities on Instagram in the aftermath of moderation -- our dataset contains 2.5M posts between 2011 and 2014. We find that the pro-ED community has adopted non-standard lexical variations of moderated tags to circumvent these restrictions. In fact, increasingly complex lexical variants have emerged over time. Communities that use lexical variants show increased participation and support of pro-ED (15-30%). Finally, the tags associated with content on these variants express more toxic, self-harm, and vulnerable content. Despite Instagram's moderation strategies, pro-ED communities are active and thriving. We discuss the effectiveness of content moderation as an intervention for communities of deviant behavior.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we highlight three distinct approaches to studying rumor dynamics volume, exposure, and content production. Expanding upon prior work, which has focused on rumor volume, we argue that considering the size of the exposed population is a vital component of understanding rumoring. Additionally, by combining all three approaches we discover subtle features of rumoring behavior that would have been missed by applying each approach in isolation. Using a case study of rumoring on Twitter during a hostage crisis in Sydney, Australia, we apply a mixed-methods framework to explore rumoring and its consequences through these three lenses, focusing on the added dimension of exposure in particular. Our approach demonstrates the importance of considering both rumor content and the people engaging with rumor content to arrive at a more holistic understanding of communication dynamics. These results have implications for emergency responders and official use of social media during crisis management.",

Our solution recreates the experience of a face-to-face conversation by performing 3D capture of the local user with color + depth cameras and projecting their life-size virtual copy into the remote space. This creates an illusion of the remote per-son's physical presence in the local space, as well as a shared understanding of verbal and non-verbal cues (e.g., gaze, pointing.) In addition to the technical details of two prototype implementations, we contribute strategies for projecting remote participants onto physically plausible locations, such that they form a natural and consistent conversational formation with the local participant. We also present observations and feedback from an evaluation with 7 pairs of participants on the usability of our solution for solving a collaborative, physical task.",

Yet exploring the way populations in the MENA region use social media in everyday life provides insight into how they are adapted to cultural contexts beyond those from which they originated. To better understand this process, we interviewed eleven Qatari nationals currently living in Doha, Qatar. Our analysis identifies ways users, particularly females, practice modesty, manage their own (and by extension) their family's reputation, and use social media to monitor and protect others. These findings are placed within a framework of social, or participatory surveillance, which challenges conventional notions of surveillance as a form of control and instead shows how surveillance has the potential to be empowering.",

In this panel, we explore the tensions that arise around controlling personal information online. We do so through a series of case studies around lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) identities, children, personal data exchange, and advertising. In each, we consider the politics of visibility around personal, family, social, and community identities, especially in the context of marginalized or scrutinized populations and experiences.

Here we present two instances of co-design of museum visiting aids, one stemming from an open brief, another from an initial working prototype; we discuss the process in each case and discuss how these alternative strategies presented the team with different possibilities as well as constraints, and led to different patterns of collaboration within the design team. Finally, we draw a set of themes for discussion and reflection to inform and aid researchers and practitioners participating in similar co-design processes, particularly in the domain of cultural heritage.",

To date, all scalable approaches have relied on crowd wisdom, i.e., keyword-matching on the global tweet stream to gather relevant tweets, and crowd- endorsements to judge the importance of tweets. We propose a fundamentally different methodology -- for a given topic, we identify trustworthy experts on the topic, and extract news-stories that are most popular among the experts. Comparing the crowd-based and expert-based methodologies, we demonstrate that the news-stories obtained by our methodology (i) have higher relevance for a wide variety of topics, (ii) achieve very high coverage of important news-stories posted globally in Twitter, and (iii) are far more trustworthy. Using our methodology, we implemented and publicly deployed a topical news system for Twitter, which can extract news-stories on thousands of topics.",

This paper describes CommonTies, a gentle technological in the  form of a wearable accessory, that encourages immediate, face-to-face, organic social interactions among strangers at conferences.  By not exposing any profile information, CommonTies preserves an element of  mystery and enables self-disclosure of information through conversation.  We evaluate our system through a field study at a three-day research conference - CSCW 2014. We find that despite our information-scarce  design, users were willing to interact with strangers  and 74% of the interactions initiated by CommonTies were reported as novel and useful. ",

We show how groups managed and configured themselves during the visit, revealing the strategies involved in maintaining different group behaviors. We discuss how our design accommodated different visiting styles by making objects social and scaffolding rather than directing the group experience.

Using millions of de-identified Facebook status updates with poster-annotated feelings (e.g., \"feeling thankful\" or \"feeling worried\"), we examine the magnitude and circumstances in which people share positive or negative feelings and characterize the nature of the responses they receive. We find that people share greater proportions of both positive and negative emotions when their friend networks are smaller and denser. Consistent with social sharing theory, hearing about a friend's troubles on Facebook causes friends to reply with more emotional and supportive comments. Friends' comments are also more numerous and longer. Posts with positive feelings, on the other hand, receive more likes, and their comments have more positive language. Feelings that relate to the poster's self worth, such as \"feeling defeated,\" \"feeling unloved,\" or \"feeling accomplished\" amplify these effects. ",

We then report results from a controlled online experiment with 397 participants based in the United States. Our results show that the technology used for multitasking has a significant effect on others' assumptions of what secondary activity the multitasker is likely engaged in, and that this assumed activity in turn affects evaluations of politeness and appropriateness. We also show that different layouts of the video conferencing UI can affect perception of engagement in the meeting and in turn ratings of polite or impolite behavior.

    "abstract": "Online communities, much like companies in the business world, often need to transfer \"best practices\" internally from one unit to another to improve their performance. Organizational scholars disagree about how much a recipient unit should modify a best practice when incorporating it. Some evidence indicates that modifying a practice that has been successful in one environment will introduce problems, undercut its effectiveness and harm the performance of the recipient unit. Other evidence, though, suggests that recipients need to adapt the practice to fit their local environment. The current research introduces a contingency perspective on practice transfer, holding that the value of modifications depends on when they are introduced and who introduces them. Empirical research on the transfer of a quality-improvement practice between projects within Wikipedia shows that modifications are more helpful if they are introduced after the receiving project has had experience with the imported practice. Furthermore, modifications are more effective if they are introduced by members who have experience in a variety of other projects. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper we consider how visualizations might support judgements about fairness in collaborative work. We present a qualitative investigation of meters, existing artefacts that enable awareness of contributions in the online game World of Warcraft. Through in-depth interviews with game players, we draw attention to the value of meters as tools for self-reflection and group evaluation. Yet we also describe problematic consequences that arise as a result of meters, distinguishing their usage as in-the-moment awareness tools from instruments used after the fact to apportion credit and blame. We argue that representations like meters may be enough to provoke initial questions about fairness, but are likely to undermine the efforts of collaborators if they fail to combine a set of indices that reflect important aspects of individual work in the context of team activity. We consider broader lessons for the way in which future designs might aim to support fairness in collaborative systems, pointing to multidimensional mechanisms adapted specifically to real-time or retrospective usage.",

    "abstract": "In the past few years, surgical telemedicine has emerged as a promising answer to the increasing needs of everyday surgical collaboration and education. The implicit desire is to allow a remote surgeon to see the body as the local surgeon does in order to engage in shared decision-making or instruction. With this paper we take a step back by discussing the productive and cross-referential nature of surgical practice and image use. We discuss how it is not simply a case of transferring recorded video, but rather a new practice is instantiated in creating a view of the body for the remote surgeon. In order to investigate these practices for capturing and using video, we have deployed a head-mounted video camera (via the Google Glass) in six transplant organ recovery assessments. Drawing on observations and analysis of the video recordings, we examine how the transmitting surgeon crafts a view for the remote surgeon in order to facilitate the co-construction of knowledge and shared decision making.  We use these findings to discuss further design directions for video use in expert telecommunication.",

    "abstract": "When personalities clash, teams operate less effectively. Personality differences affect face-to-face collaboration and may lower trust in virtual teams. For relatively short-lived assignments, like those of online crowdsourcing, personality matching could provide a simple, scalable strategy for effective team formation. However, it is not clear how (or if) personality differences affect teamwork in this novel context where the workforce is more transient and diverse. This study examines how personality compatibility in crowd teams affects performance and individual perceptions. Using the DISC personality test, we composed 14 five-person teams (N=70) with either a harmonious coverage of personalities (balanced) or a surplus of leader-type personalities (imbalanced). Results show that balancing for personality leads to significantly better performance on a collaborative task. Balanced teams exhibited less conflict and their members reported higher levels of satisfaction and acceptance. This work demonstrates a simple personality matching strategy for forming more effective teams in crowdsourcing contexts. ",

This paper explores the various ways in which people create and use multiple user representations, specifically in online games. Using 8 years of population data from a popular multiplayer online game, EVE Online, we examine how multiple character creation and use occurs at scale and how operationalization of individuals between accounts and characters impacts methods. We suggest that conceptualizing participants in online games based on the assumption that one character equals one individual can lead to incorrect analyses regarding the demographics or behaviors of the population. Additionally, social network analysis suggests that a character-centric, rather than account-level, viewpoint can change the results of statistical relationships with network metrics such as eigenvector centrality.",

Yet this very convenience can be troublesome to both the individual and the group involved if receivers intentionally or unintentionally hit one button instead of the other. In this paper we explore how replying decisions are made and what contributes to erroneous use of Reply All through an experimental study (N=109) and a survey study (N=112). Data from the experiment suggest that errors are not influenced by how the reply button suite is arranged but rather by the explicitness of the desired response action and how multiple recipients are displayed. Qualitative data from the survey suggest that while people are cognizant of Reply All misuse, lack of universally agreed upon criteria for appropriate Reply/Reply All choice leads to errors. We discuss the implications of these insights for email interface design. ",

    "abstract": "Many online social networks thrive on automatic sharing of friends' activities to a user through activity feeds, which may influence the user's next actions. However, identifying such social influence is tricky because these activities are simultaneously impacted by influence and homophily. We propose a statistical procedure that uses commonly available network and observational data about people's actions to estimate the extent of copy-influence---mimicking others' actions that appear in a feed.  We assume that non-friends don't influence users; thus, comparing how a user's activity correlates with friends versus non-friends who have similar preferences can help tease out the effect of copy-influence.   Experiments on datasets from multiple social networks show that estimates that don't account for homophily overestimate copy-influence by varying, often large amounts. Further, copy-influence estimates fall below 1% of total actions in all networks: most people, and almost all actions, are not affected by the feed. Our results question common perceptions around the extent of copy-influence in online social networks and suggest improvements to diffusion and recommendation models.",

Although CSCW researchers have shown the potential for social computing technologies to help patients and their caregivers manage chronic conditions and support health behavior change, few studies focus on caregivers' role during a multi-day hospital stay. To explore this space, we conducted an interview and observation study of patients and caregivers in the inpatient setting. In this paper, we describe how caregivers and patients coordinate and collaborate to manage patients' care and wellbeing during a hospital stay. We define and describe five roles caregivers adopt: companion, assistant, representative, navigator, and planner, and show how patients and caregivers negotiate these roles and responsibilities throughout a hospital stay. Finally, we identify key design considerations for technology to support patients and caregivers during a hospital stay. ",

We use this approach in tandem with other more conventional multimedia methods (i.e.\\\\ computer vision and contextual metadata) to form a broad multimodal approach to retrieval and recommendation.

Consequently, the privacy of mobile interfaces has hampered social observability and chances for serendipitous interactions. For example, reading an electronic newspaper with a mobile device does not allow the surrounding people to be similarly aware of the reader's activity as traditional newspapers. Social displays are additional displays on mobile devices providing the surrounding people with light-weight cues about the activities of the device user. We implemented a prototype that reveals the user's current active application and presents its name on an e-ink display on the backside of a mobile device. We conducted a ten-day field trial with 13 participants using the prototype. The results show that the prototype was able to increase awareness of users' mobile activities and occasionally triggered interactions with others, without significantly violating the sense of privacy.",

We reviewed literature on coordination studies, interviewed offshore service providers in the Philippines, and used thematic analysis to analyse coordination practices from the point of view of these individual vendors in a newly industrialized country. We used Olson and Olson's framework on 'collaboration at a distance' as a lens to structure the results. The study provides an understanding of vendors' individual attitudes towards the coordination of distributed work and draws attention to how differences in power affect the work situation of vendors, and by implication all stakeholders. We offer this insight as a way to enhance existing CSCW frameworks, by imbuing them with the perspective of non-equal relationships. The study found that vendors were generally able to produce outputs that satisfy their clients, however these results were only achieved because individuals were willing to take risks and make sacrifices in their personal lives. The relationship was further characterised by a complex interplay between the client's control of the overall work arrangements and the vendors' ability to establish a level of autonomy in their work practices and their flexible use of coordination tools.",

It is largely presumed that understandings of people's everyday interactions will be relatively easy to 'read off' of such data and that this, in turn, poses a privacy threat. An ethnographic study of how people account for sensed data to third parties uncovers serious challenges to such ideas. The study reveals that the legibility of sensor data turns upon various orders of situated reasoning involved in articulating the data and making it accountable.

    "abstract": "Most work around technological interventions for energy conservation to date has focussed on changing individual behaviour. Hence, there is limited understanding of communal settings, such as office environments, as sites for intervention. Even when energy consumption in the workplace has been considered, the emphasis has typically been on the individual. To address this gap, we conducted a study of energy consumption and management in one workplace, based on a combination of workshops with a broad range of stakeholders, and quantitative data inspections. We report and discuss findings from this study, in light of prior literature, and we present a set of implications for design and further research. In particular, three themes, and associated intervention opportunities, emerged from our data: (1) energy wastage related to ``errors\"; (2) the role of company policies and the negotiation that surrounds their implementation; and (3) the bigger energy picture of procurement, construction and travel.",

    "abstract": "More than 350 million people worldwide suffer from depression. Major depressive disorder has a hugely negative impact on psychological well-being, work, and family life. Yet culture may shape how depressed patients interpret their symptoms, choose treatments, and behave. This paper reports a case study, including participant observations and interviews, of the Chinese online depression community, SunForum. Our findings reveal that Chinese cultural beliefs (e.g., the power of inner self-control) and Chinese beliefs about traditional medicine (e.g., the integrated body-mind relationship) significantly affect patients' understandings of depression, illness management, and social interactions. These beliefs create problems of understanding depression in society \"\u00d0 including family members, friends, co-workers, and others \"\u00d0 and present various challenges for depressed patients who can become marginalized, suffer discrimination, and lose their jobs. We draw implications for how Chinese society as a whole may respond to the misunderstanding of mental illness and the raising of public awareness. We also propose specific social media design to support depressed patients as they seek online information and social support.",

    "abstract": "Mobile crowd-tasking markets are growing at an unprecedented rate with increasing number of smartphone users. Such platforms differ from their online counterparts in that they demand physical mobility and can benefit from smartphone processors and sensors for verification purposes. Despite the importance of such mobile crowd-tasking markets, little is known about the labor supply dynamics and mobility patterns of the users.  In this paper we design, develop and experiment with a real-world mobile crowd-tasking platform, called TA$Ker. Our contributions are two-fold: (a) We develop TA$Ker, a system that allows us to empirically study the worker responses to push vs. pull strategies for task recommendation and selection. (b) We evaluate our system via experimentation with 80 real users on our campus, over a 4 week period with a corpus of over 1000 tasks. We then provide an in-depth analysis of labor supply, worker behavior & task selection preferences (including the phenomenon of super agents who complete large portions of the tasks) and the efficacy of push-based approaches that recommend tasks based on predicted movement patterns of individual workers.",

Using a multi-methods and multinational approach, we investigated Facebook users' privacy behavior by focusing on how they co-manage private information. Our findings from focus-group interviews (n = 28) and online surveys (n = 299) suggest that Facebook users primarily apply four different practices of privacy management: collaborative strategies, corrective strategies, preventive strategies, and information control. The four dimensions of privacy management display selective relationships with theoretical antecedents (e.g., self-efficacy, collective-efficacy, attitudes, privacy concern), indicating that each behavior is motivated by a different combination of conditions. Implications for research and practice are discussed. ",

The system relies on public interactive kiosks to collect human estimations about their queue waiting time. The system has been designed as a standalone tool that can be retrospectively embedded in a variety of locations without interfacing with billing or customer systems. An initial study was conducted in order to determine whether people who just joined the queue would differ in their estimates from people who were at the front of the queue. We then present our system's evaluation in four different restaurants over 19 weekdays. Our analysis shows how our system is perceived by users, and we develop 2 ways to optimise the waiting time estimation: by correcting the estimations based on the position of the input mechanism, and by changing the sliding window considered inputs to provide better prediction. Our analysis shows that approximately 7% of restaurant customers provided estimations, but even so our system can provide predictions with up to 2 minute mean absolute error.",

Through interviews and participatory observations with a group of people with motor disabilities in China, we found that their perceived limited capabilities to reciprocate, or feelings of indebtedness, were among the main reasons that kept them from interacting with others. The study shows that ICT and communities of people with disabilities are valuable in relieving these issues, in that they provide means and opportunities for them to give help and in turn develop self-esteem, crucial for their social interaction and integration. Our study suggests providing ways for them to give and not simply receive help as an important means to support their social interaction and integration in particular, by focusing on their abilities and communities, instead of disabilities and independence.",

The majority of care for chronically ill people is realized by non-professionals, the relatives, who are often overlooked. Many of these informal caregivers are also elderly and face multiple, seriously demanding challenges in the context of informal care 24/7. In order to support this increasing user group, their cooperative work and coordination adequately, it is essential to gain a better understanding of their care practices and needs. This paper is based on ethnography in ten households in Germany. It combines data from the analysis of participant observations over eight months, interviews and cultural probes. Besides detailed descriptions of two cases, the central features of informal care experience and implications for design are discussed: the self-concept of the caregivers as being care experts, the need for social support, timing issues and coordination with other actors in this field.",

Contrarily, in Chile and other Latin American countries, most older adults live close to their families, are usually dependent of the latter, and rarely use digital means to communicate. Through cross-generational interviews, we identified attitudes, agreements, and expectations that describe how middle class Chilean families, living in urban settlements, interact with their elders. The study findings indicate that the approach used by the adult children to take care of their parents produces a vicious circle that stresses out the former and limits the technology adoption of the latter. Therefore, new ways of interacting with the elderly are required and digital technology has the potential to produce this change.",

Using Instagram as a case study, we analyze data from 254 public Instagram users associated with the Tribal Digital Village (TDV) network in Southern California. Our analysis of over 1.2 million unique Instagram posts reveals that Instagram users in the TDV network interact with locally generated content 46.6\u00d5\u008b more often than content generated by users from outside the network. We use our observations of OSN usage to compare five OSN content scheduling approaches. Our evaluation reveals that up to 81% of users received at least half of their content requests and 35.5% of the 1.1 million requested Instagram photos were transmitted to users. ",

We describe how a new IT system for hospital logistics provided porters with more influence on, and responsibility for their work; supported collaboration among porters, clinicians, and middle management; and effected a new ecology of visibility and accountability of porters' work. We discuss how the new system simultaneously supported collaboration and generated representations and accounts of porters' work. We compare the particular work arrangement in this study with other studies of porters' work, show the widely different configurations of how IT and work can be organized, and argue for the benefit of making comparative studies within CSCW. Finally, we argue for moving beyond dualisms of coordination and accountability for work.",

In this paper, we present BudgetMap, an issue-driven classification and navigation interface for the budgets of government programs. Our novel issue-driven approach can complement the traditional budget classification system used by government organizations by reflecting time-evolving public interests. BudgetMap elicits the public to tag government programs with social issues by providing two modes of tagging. User-initiated tagging allows people to voluntarily search for programs of interest and classify each program with related social issues, while system-initiated tagging guides people through possible matches of issues and programs via microtasks. BudgetMap then facilitates visual exploration of the tagged budget data. Our evaluation shows that participants' awareness and understanding of budgetary issues increased after using BudgetMap, while they collaboratively identified issue-budget links with quality comparable to expert-generated links.",

While running tasks on crowdsourcing platforms a requester experiences long tails in execution caused by abandoned assignments (those left by workers unfinished), which become available for other workers only after some expiration time (e.g., 30 minutes in CrowdFlower). These abandoned assignments result in significant delays and a poor predictability of the overall task execution time. In this paper, we propose an approach and an implementation called ReLauncher to identify such abandoned assignments and relaunch them for other workers. We evaluate our implementation with an experiment on CrowdFlower that provides substantive evidence for a significant execution speed improvement with an average extra cost of about 10%.",

Such social-emotional learning (SEL) curricula are most effective if reinforced by parents, thus transferring the skills into everyday contexts. Traditional SEL programs have however had limited success in engaging parents, and we argue that technology might be able to help bridge this school-home divide. Through interviews with SEL experts we identified central design considerations for technology and SEL content: the reliance on experiential learning and the need to scaffold the parents in scaffolding the interaction for their children. This informed the design of a technology probe comprising a magnet card and online SEL activities, deployed in a school and via Mturk. The results provide a nuanced understanding of how technology-based interventions could bridge the school-home gap in real-world settings and support at-home reinforcement of children's social-emotional skills.

EMCA approaches can complement existing perspectives through articulating how social media is embedded in the everyday lives of its users and how sequentiality of social media use organises this embeddedness.

We introduce a metric (DSCORE) to characterize early activity diversity in online sites and run our analyses on an online community 'MovieLens'. We find that DSCORE is significant both by itself and in conjunction with a measure of quantity of activity in predicting longevity. This finding is robust to different measures of longevity (aggregate number of sessions and attritions after sessions 1, 5, and 10). The immediate implication is an effective classifier for identifying users with higher (or lower) expected longevity from the first-session activity. We also find DSCORE is more useful than a traditional measure of measuring diversity such as the Gini-Simpson index. We conclude by discussing how early activity diversity may be more broadly effective in supporting design and management of online communities.",

To validate the model and advance our understanding about online self-disclosure, we applied it to de-identified, aggregated status updates from Facebook users. Results show that women self-disclose more than men. People with a stronger desire to manage impressions self-disclose less. Network size is negatively associated with self-disclosure, while tie strength and network density are positively associated.",

    "abstract": "High-risk outdoor recreation allows its enthusiasts to reach unprecedented levels of adrenaline; it also contains risks and requires specific training (in part technological). In particular, its participants must be ready to react efficiently during an emergency or in response to an accident. Technological training grounds can simulate particular contexts and emergency situations as a place for recreationists to train and practice. In this paper, we use the practice of avalanche companion rescue as a case study to explore how technological training grounds support recreationist training. Our results offer insights into how avalanche beacon training parks support skill development and team coordination training. We also present strategies to orient the design of technological training grounds beyond avalanche companion rescue. ",

    "abstract": "Personalized support for students is a gold standard in education, but it scales poorly with the number of students. Prior work on learnersourcing presented an approach for learners to engage in human computation tasks while trying to learn a new skill. Our key insight is that students, through their own experience struggling with a particular problem, can become experts on the particular optimizations they implement or bugs they resolve. These students can then generate hints for fellow students based on their new expertise. We present workflows that harvest and organize students' collective knowledge and advice for helping fellow novices through design problems in engineering. Systems embodying each workflow were evaluated in the context of a college-level computer architecture class with an enrollment of more than two hundred students each semester. We show that, given our design choices, students can create helpful hints for their peers that augment or even replace teachers' personalized assistance, when that assistance is not available.",

In this controlled between-subjects experiment, participants were presented with an online consent form for a personal genomics study. Individuals were randomly assigned to either a social annotation condition that exposed them to previous users' comments on-screen, or to a traditional consent form without social input. We compared participants' perceptions about their consent decision, their trust in the organization seeking the consent, and their actual consent across conditions. While no significant difference was observed between actual consent rates, we found that on average individuals exposed to social annotation felt that their decision was more informed, and furthermore, that the effect of the exposure to social annotation was stronger among users characterized by relatively lower levels of prior privacy preserving behaviors.

We present findings from an interview study of 11 individuals and a survey study of 60 individuals, all with little to no functional vision. Compared to sighted SNS users, our blind participants faced profound accessibility challenges, including the prevalence of photos without sufficient text descriptions. To overcome the challenges, they developed creative strategies, including using a variety of methods to access SNS features (e.g., opening the mobile site on a desktop browser), and inferring photo content from textual cues and social interactions. When strategies failed, participants reached out for help from trusted friends, or avoided certain features. We discuss our findings in the context of CSCW research and SNS accessibility as a design value. We highlight the social significance of photo interactions for blind people and suggest design practices. ",

Fundamentally, the work that is done consists of various methods of accounting for mobile device use, and displaying involvement in social interaction while the device is used. We highlight multiple examples of the nuanced ways in which interleaving is problematic in interaction, and relate our findings to the CSCW and HCI literature on collocated interaction.

    "abstract": "Highly mobile knowledge workers spend a large portion of their time traversing within and among different infrastructural configurations as they move through space. These dynamic configurations are experienced as either technological or contextual constraints, which range from forms of technological exclusion and infrastructural disconnection to divides caused by both spatial and organizational boundaries. The workaday nature of these constrained environments force mobile workers to engage in a type of articulation work that involves the construction of bridging, assembling, or circumventing solutions to repeatedly negotiate these impediments. Engaging in these 'infrastructuring' practices requires that workers develop 'infrastructural competence' knowledge of the generative possibilities of infrastructural seams. In effect, this renders mobile workers as infrastructural bricoleurs. We discuss the implications of this required competence and speculate regarding its origin, maintenance, and differentiation among professions.",

    "abstract": "Crowdsourcing is a common strategy for collecting the \"gold standard\" labels required for many natural language applications. Crowdworkers differ in their responses for many reasons, but existing approaches often treat disagreements as \"noise\" to be removed through filtering or aggregation. In this paper, we introduce the workflow design pattern of crowd parting: separating workers based on shared patterns in responses to a crowdsourcing task. We illustrate this idea using an automated clustering-based method to identify divergent, but valid, worker interpretations in crowdsourced entity annotations collected over two distinct corpora -- Wikipedia articles and Tweets. We demonstrate how the intermediate-level view provide by crowd-parting analysis provides insight into sources of disagreement not easily gleaned from viewing either individual annotation sets or aggregated results. We discuss several concrete applications for how this approach could be applied directly to improving the quality and efficiency of crowdsourced annotation tasks.",

Following a survey of 222 FOSS developers, we find conflict to have an overall negative effect on developer retention. Furthermore, different types of conflict have varying impact on outcomes. In particular, only normative conflict levels negatively impact intention to remain in a FOSS project. Both normative and process conflict negatively affect perceptions of team performance, while the co-occurrence of task and process conflict exacerbate negative effects on outcomes. Though we find structural factors like task interdependence and geographical distribution increase overall conflict levels in FOSS teams, participatory decision-making and a transformational leadership style have an ameliorating effect.

    "abstract": "Compounding of natural language units is a very common phenomena. In this paper, we show, for the first time, that Twitter hashtags which, could be considered as correlates of such linguistic units, undergo compounding.  We identify reasons for this compounding and propose a prediction model that can identify with 77.07% accuracy if a pair of hashtags compounding in the near future (i.e., 2 months after compounding) shall become popular. At longer times T = 6, 10 months the accuracies are 77.52% and 79.13% respectively. This technique has strong implications to trending hashtag recommendation since newly formed hashtag compounds can be recommended early, even before the compounding has taken place. Further, humans can predict compounds with an overall accuracy of only 48.7% (treated as baseline). Notably, while humans can discriminate the relatively easier cases, the automatic framework is successful in classifying the relatively harder cases.",

Members aligned anticipated outcomes in opposition to our guidelines and abandoned projects due to personal obligations. In reflecting on these encounters we further show how workshops shape what it means to study collaborative settings.

Using this filtering, a large-scale experiment with real users was performed to mea- sure the resulting engagement and satisfaction. To our knowledge, this experiment represents the first reported large-scale user study of automatically curating social media content in real time.

In this paper, we explore how to improve crowd innovation with real-time expert guidance. One approach would for experts to provide personalized feed-back, but this scales poorly, and may lead to premature convergence during creative work. Drawing on strategies for facilitating face-to-face brainstorms, we introduce a crowd ideation system where experts monitor incoming ideas through a dashboard and offer high-level \"inspirations\" to guide ideation. A series of controlled experiments show that experienced facilitators increased the quantity and creativity of workers' ideas compared to unfacilitated workers, while Novice facilitators reduced workers' creativity. Analyses of inspiration strategies suggest these opposing results stem from differential use of successful inspiration strategies (e.g., provoking mental simulations). The results show that expert facilitation can significantly improve crowd innovation, but inexperienced facilitators may need scaffolding to be successful.",

This paper examines methods for addressing this cold-start problem in datamining-bootstrappable communities by attracting non-members to contribute to the community. We make four contributions: 1) we characterize a set of communities that are \"datamining-bootstrappable\" and define the bootstrapping problem in terms of decision-theoretic optimization, 2) we estimate the model parameters in a case study involving the Open AI Resources website, 3) we demonstrate that non-members' predicted interest levels and request design are important features that can significantly affect the contribution rate, and 4) we ran a simulation experiment using  data generated with the learned parameters and show that our decision-theoretic optimization algorithm can generate as much community utility when bootstrapping the community as our strongest baseline while issuing only 55% as many contribution requests.",

In this paper, we demonstrate an approach in which non-experts identify domains that have the potential to yield useful and non-obvious inspirations for solutions. We report an empirical study demonstrating how crowds can generate domains of expertise and that showing people an abstract representation rather than the original problem helps them identify more distant domains. Crowd workers drawing inspirations from the distant domains produced more creative solutions to the original problem than did those who sought inspiration on their own, or drew inspiration from domains closer to or not sharing structural correspondence with the original problem.

This paper contributes a systematic crowdsourcing approach for eliciting multiple constraints inherent in a problem and using those constraints to find inspirations useful in solving it. To do so we identify methods to elicit useful constraints at different levels of abstraction, and empirical results that identify how the level of abstraction influences creative idea generation.

Our findings revealed teens' desire for expressive technology that helps them initiate dialogue, negotiate conflicts, and restrict communication with family, and their desired degree of engagement with tools promoting healthy eating (passively to actively involved in behavior change). Our analysis further yielded crosscutting themes: the importance of examining issues of self-efficacy, locus of control, and socio-ecological context in the design of health technology. We use our findings to contribute new directions for CSCW research: developing a nuanced perspective on the psychology of change, designing for varying levels of self-efficacy and locus of control, and problematizing the persuasive technology research agenda.

    "abstract": "Protecting the privacy of crowd workers has been an important topic in crowdsourcing, however, task privacy has largely been ignored despite the fact that many tasks, e.g., form digitization, live audio transcription or image tagging often contain sensitive information.  Although assigning an entire job to a worker may leak private information, jobs can often be split into small components that individually do not. We study the problem of distributing such tasks to workers with the goal of maximizing task privacy using such an approach.   We introduce information loss functions to formally measure the amount of private information leaked as a function of the task assignment. We then design assignment mechanisms for three different assignment settings: PUSH, PULL and a new setting Tug Of War (TOW), which is an intermediate approach that balances flexibility for both workers and requesters. Our assignment algorithms have zero privacy loss for PUSH,  and tight theoretical guarantees for PULL. For TOW, our assignment algorithm provably outperforms PULL; importantly the privacy loss is independent of the number of tasks, even when workers collude. We further analyze the performance and privacy tradeoffs empirically on simulated and real-world collusion networks and find that our algorithms outperform the theoretical guarantees. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a case study of an urban organic food community and examine the way the community shapes its artifact ecology through a combination of appropriation of freely or cheaply available tools, and the long-term effort of building the community's own website. Based on participatory observation, content analysis of communication documents, and a series of interviews, we see how the collection of artifacts that a community uses to support their practice form what we refer to as their community artifact ecology. A community artifact ecology is multifaceted, dynamic and pending on what the members bring to the table, as well as on particular situations of use. The community artifact ecology concept is important for CSCW as it enables framing of the relationship between communities and technologies beyond the single artifact and beyond a static view of a dedicated technology.",

However, most urban technologies that aim to foster social interaction tend to rely on screens, directing a significant proportion of the users' attention towards the device rather than to those with whom the encounter is shared. We present the design and evaluation of the Jokebox, a lightweight technology that requires two passers-by to coordinate actions to hear a joke. In three in the wild studies at different locations we found that our design supported micro-level coordination in a consistent manner: by encouraging people to make eye contact and by using audible jokes, users engaged in interactions that often led to further conversation and laughter. We describe how opportunities for macro-level coordination were key to the success of the installation, but varied by context. Finally, we present design implications for considering both the micro and macro levels of social coordination. ",

    "abstract": "Research on small team collaboration repeatedly shows that \"distance matters\". More recent work has refined this concept of distance to develop geographic dispersion measures to explain the negative effects that team configuration has on productivity and interaction. Dispersion measures explain why teams distributed across multiple time zones, or across multiple sites, have more coordination difficulties than collocated teams with a single remote member. Although larger online communities are increasingly used in enterprises, few studies have examined the effects of dispersion on community behavior. We studied 1206 online enterprise communities (OECs), each using a set of collaborative tools. We present new data showing counter-intuitively that OEC dispersion does not affect content generation or contribution inequality, even when restricting community size to those that most resemble small teams (with 3-12 members). We found that previously documented negative effects of geographic dispersion seem to be reduced in enterprise communities regardless of size. Our results provide additional support to prior case studies suggesting that online communities can mitigate geographic dispersion by providing resources that support coordination and resource sharing.",

Although several studies highlighted the benefits of gamification in many applications, its potential in the \\\\emph{enterprise} environment still needs to be fully understood.   This work contributes to the studies in enterprise gamification with an experiment performed at a large multinational company. The experiment involved 206 employees for a period of 2 months. We describe a modular and extensible framework for enterprise gamification, designed to seamlessly integrate with existing enterprise-class Web systems. We studied how a gamified tool can help to foster employees' engagement with such systems, by making day-to-day tasks more stimulating.   We show how different game mechanics can help to achieve two business needs, namely social interaction and learning. To this end, we exploited the gamification framework to develop a Q&A Web application combined with learning, news sharing, and social connections capabilities. Results provide strong evidence of how a gamified experience can foster learning and social behaviour in employees, and provide new insights about the effectiveness of several game mechanics in an enterprise context.",

Comparatively, however, the importance of these technologies within geographically close romantic relationships has been overlooked. The present study fills in this gap by examining the prevalence of media use in this context and its association with relational well-being. A survey of heterosexual undergraduates involved in proximal dating relationships (N = 211) shows that they used mobile media (phone calls, texting) to a significant extent to connect with partners on a daily basis, and that they reported high quality of communication when using these media. Further, the quality, but not quantity, of mobile communication was associated with partner idealization which, in turn, was associated with relational satisfaction. The results support and extend the Hyperpersonal model of online communication, and contribute to elucidating user practices and media effects within the critical domain of romantic relationships.

As new faces are selected using stringent (and often criticized) aesthetic criteria, a priori predictions are made difficult by information cascades and other fundamental trend-setting mechanisms. However, the increasing usage of social media within and without the industry may be affecting this traditional system. We therefore seek to understand the ingredients of success of fashion models in the age of Instagram. Combining data from a comprehensive online fashion database and the popular mobile image-sharing platform, we apply a ma- chine learning framework to predict the tenure of a cohort of new faces for the 2015 Spring/Summer season throughout the subsequent 2015-16 Fall / Winter season. Our framework successfully predicts most of the new popular models who appeared in 2015.

Likes and other kinds of lightweight affirmation serve as social cues of acceptance and maintain interpersonal relationships, but may mean different things to different people. Through surveys and de-identified, aggregated behavioral Facebook data, we find that in general, people care more about who Likes their posts than how many Likes they receive, desiring feedback most from close friends, romantic partners, and family members other than their parents. While most people do not feel strongly that receiving \"enough\" Likes is important, roughly two-thirds of posters regularly receive more than \"enough.\" We also note a \"Like paradox,\" a phenomenon in which people's friends receive more Likes because their friends have more friends to provide those Likes. Individuals with lower levels of self-esteem and higher levels of self-monitoring are more likely to think that Likes are important and to feel bad if they do not receive \"enough\" Likes.

Policy orbits around this core as a persistent but marginally represented presence.  In the last few years, however, CSCW has witnessed an upsurge of interest in (re)integrating policy more explicitly and meaningfully into research and practice. For example, recent scholarship stressed the mutually constitutive and interconnected threads of design, practice, and policy [31]. This paper expands upon those motivations through a qualitative case study of the role of policy in library mass digitization work and the subsequent emergence and evolution of the HathiTrust cooperative partnership.  By tracing the origins and impacts of early policy decisions in this context, this research contributes to understandings of how and why policy can both close and open spaces of social practice and technical design, functioning as a source of embedded generativity in complex sociotechnical systems.

    "abstract": "People from all over the world use social media to share thoughts and opinions about events, and understanding what people say through these channels has been of increasing interest to researchers, journalists, and marketers alike. However, while automatically generated summaries enable people to consume large amounts of data efficiently, they do not provide the context needed for a viewer to fully understand an event. Narrative structure can provide templates for the order and manner in which this data is presented to create stories that are oriented around narrative elements rather than summaries made up of facts. In this paper, we use narrative theory as a framework for identifying the links between social media content. To do this, we designed crowdsourcing tasks to generate summaries of events based on commonly used narrative templates. In a controlled study, for certain types of events, people were more emotionally engaged with stories created with narrative structure and were also more likely to recommend them to others compared to summaries created without narrative structure.",

    "abstract": "To assist users' privacy decision-making with mobile applications, prior research has investigated ways of enhancing information transparency, via improving privacy permission interfaces. This study takes a soft paternalism approach by proposing two interface cues as \"privacy nudges\" in a mobile permission interface: the frequency nudge indicates how frequently user information is used, and the social nudge presents the percentage of other users approving certain data permission. We compared the effects of these privacy nudges on users' creepiness emotion and privacy attitudes, through a between-subject online experimental study (n=387). Our results suggest that privacy nudges are effective in altering privacy attitudes, but the direction of effects depends on the nudge's framing valence. In addition, the creepiness emotion mediates the relationship between nudging and privacy attitudes.",

    "abstract": "Social network site (SNS) platforms have the potential to be effective information-seeking channels due to their technical and social affordances, such as the ability to broadcast content to a large group and to aggregate one's contacts. This study tests the impact of a Facebook app that allows users to visualize their network of Facebook Friends to see how it influences who adolescents identify as good sources of information about college. Comparing Friends selected by 24 high school seniors before and after viewing Facebook network visualizations reveals that first-generation students were more likely to select higher quality information sources among their Facebook Friends after exposure to the visualization. Our results suggest that social media can help users identify good human information sources by making hidden resources in one's network more visible.",

    "abstract": "Often, attention to \"community\" focuses on motivating core members or helping newcomers become regulars. However, much of the traffic to online communities comes from people who visit only briefly. We hypothesize that their personal characteristics, design elements of the site, and others' activity all affect the contributions these \"one-timers\" make. We present the results from an experiment asking Amazon Mechanical Turk (\"AMT\") workers to comment on the AMT participation agreement in a discussion forum. One-timers with stronger ties to other Turkers or feelings of trust for Amazon are more likely to leave more --- but shorter and less relevant --- comments, while those with higher self-efficacy leave longer and more relevant comments. The phrasing of prompts also matters; a general appeal for personally-reflective contributions leads to comments that are less relevant to community discussion topics. Finally, activity matters too; synchronous activity begets responses, while pre-existing content tends to suppress them. These findings suggest design moves that can help communities harness this \"long tail\" of contribution.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine whether monitoring moderated the impact of trust on the project performance of 57 virtual teams. Two sources of monitoring were examined: internal monitoring done by team members and external monitoring done by someone outside of the team. Two types of trust were also examined: affective-based trust, or trust based on emotion; and cognitive trust, or trust based on competency. Results indicate that when internal monitoring was high, affective trust was associated with increases in performance. However, affective trust was associated with decreases in performance when external monitoring was high. Both types of monitoring reduced the strong positive relationship between cognitive trust and the performance of virtual teams. Results of this study provide new insights about monitoring and trust in virtual teams and inform both theory and design.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the empirical case of an aging and obsolescent infrastructure supporting a space science mission that is currently approaching a known end. Such a case contributes to our understanding of the degrading path at the end-of-life of an infrastructure. During this later stage in the life of infrastructure we can observe common issues associated with aging infrastructures \"\u00d0 hardware's material decay, programming languages and software tools reaching end of support, obsolete managerial methodologies, etc. Such a case of infrastructural decay reveals how work of infrastructure maintenance may reach the limits of repair and shift from repair-as-sustaining into a mode of repair-into-decay, actively working towards the end-of-life. What this reveals is that, rather than infrastructural decay being a natural by-product of time's passing, there is active work that goes into producing a convivial decay in which the multiple temporalities of aging and decay are brought into alignment through negotiation of what aging means, its impacts on different forms of work, and even what counts as old and new.",

    "abstract": "Pervasive information streams that document people and their routines have been a boon to social computing research. But the ethics of collecting and analyzing available but potentially sensitive online data present challenges to researchers. In response to increasing public and scholarly debate over the ethics of online data research, this paper analyzes the current state of practice among researchers using online data. Qualitative and quantitative responses from a survey of 263 online data researchers document beliefs and practices around which social computing researchers are converging, as well as areas of ongoing disagreement. The survey also reveals that these disagreements are not correlated with disciplinary, methodological, or workplace affiliations. The paper concludes by reflecting on changing ethical practices in the digital age, and discusses a set of emergent best practices for ethical social computing research.",

    "abstract": "When health services involve long-term treatment over months or years, providers have the ability, not present in acute emergency care, to collaboratively reflect on clients' changing health data and adjust interventions. In this paper, we discuss temporality as a factor in the design of health information technology. We define a temporal spectrum ranging from time-critical services that benefit from standardization to long-term services that require more flexibility. We provide empirical evidence from fieldwork that we performed in organizations providing long-term behavioral and mental health services for children. Our fieldwork in this context complements and provides contrasts to previous CSCW studies performed in time-critical hospital settings. Current literature shows a bias toward standardized records and routines in the implementation of health information technology, a policy that may not be appropriate for long-term health services. We discuss how the design of information systems should vary based on temporal factors. ",

    "abstract": "Are one's individual biases stronger when mediated communication is used? This paper examines the role of self-esteem-related biases and communication channel during romantic couple conflict. Romantic couples communicated about a conflict either face-to-face (FtF) or via instant messenger (IM). Results revealed that for people with lower levels of self-esteem, their negative biases were triggered when they communicated with their partners via IM; people with lower levels of self-esteem had more negative assessments of the conflict discussion and of the impact of the discussion on the relationship when communicating via IM than when communicating FtF. At a theoretical level, this work deepens our understanding of how individual difference variables like self-esteem impact how individuals process information and communicate via technology. At a practical level, findings suggest that the use of mediated communication during conflict is more harmful to certain individuals than to others.",

    "abstract": "Anonymity online is important to people at times in their lives. Anonymous communication applications such as Whisper and YikYak enable people to communicate with strangers anonymously through their smartphones. We report results from semi-structured interviews with 18 users of these apps. The goal of our study was to identify why and how people use anonymous apps, their perceptions of their audience and interactions on the apps, and how these apps compare with other online social communities. We present a typology of the content people share, and their motivations for participation in anonymous apps. People share various types of content that range from deep confessions and secrets to lighthearted jokes and momentary feelings. An important driver for participation and posting is to get social validation from others, even though they are anonymous strangers. We also find that participants believe these anonymous apps allow more honesty, openness, and diversity of opinion than they can find elsewhere. Our results provide implications for how anonymity in mobile apps can encourage expressiveness and interaction among users.",

    "abstract": "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have experienced rapid growth and attracted significant attention within aca-demia. However, despite widespread acceptance of MOOCs as a unique opportunity to transform educational practices, many questions remain regarding their sustainability, given the high dropout rates and challenges related to collabora-tive learning support [12]. Recent research has attempted to address these concerns by analyzing students' MOOC expe-riences and how MOOCs may fall short in meeting stu-dents' learning needs [41]. However, very little research has approached the problem from an instructor perspective. We report an interview study of 14 MOOC instructors in which we used grounded theory to uncover the complex processes, motivations, and challenges associated with teaching a MOOC. A key finding is that we should provide support through the whole instruction process. By enhancing sup-port for instructors and their MOOC collaborators, we may improve outcomes for all MOOC stakeholders, including students. ",

    "abstract": "Emergencies are critical situations that demand immediate action to avoid adverse consequences to life and property. A key challenge in Emergency Management is decision-making under time pressure, with an overload of unconfirmed, uncertain and conflicting information, including the management of many people, with distinct and possibly fluid roles, in different places. Collaboration in these settings is an interesting element, since emergency response generally involves multiple agencies and the public, which have different views, protocols and priorities, but must act in concert to handle the situation. In addition, an increasing amount of virtual information is necessary to inform and manage volunteers. The goal of this workshop is to identify and map the main challenges of collaboration in crisis situations, review current research methods and approaches to address them and from there to address the lack of formal processes, structures, methodologies and tools, following a multidisciplinary approach.

As IIH grows through organizational and regulatory mechanisms, CSCW researchers grapple with the shifting nature of healthcare data.

Yet, while medical record keeping is still a primary function of IIH, second order data usages are increasingly large foci of IIH design and use. Facilitating development of health data practice and infrastructure is an area ripe for CSCW research. Critical topics include but are not limited to: re-use of clinical data for second order usages; design of artifacts and infrastructures; politics of creating and using data; algorithmic authority of IIH and effects on the exercise of expertise and discretion of healthcare professions; new forms of healthcare data work, including new occupations; data-driven accountability and management in healthcare.",
