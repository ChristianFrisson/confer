    "abstract": "It is hard to deny that our artifacts and environments are becoming more and more complex, more and more \u00e2\u0080\u009calive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and as a consequence more and more demanding. We have to interact more. There seems to be no retreat or escape from interactivity. Some well-informed critics worry that the proliferation of interactions and interactive things has already gone too far. Their concerns raise many questions. Does interactivity in fact increase? How can we know? What does it really mean to claim that it does? And if indeed it is increasing, what does it mean? And why is this happening? And should something be done? Despite this development there seems to be no precise idea of what interaction is and what being interactive means, beyond a vague notion that it is some kind of interplay, usually optimistically understood as good-natured cooperation.\n\nIn this talk I will present the work I have, together with my colleague Lars-Erik Janlert, done for many years. As our approach, maybe best described as analytical and philosophical, we have examined properties and qualities of designed artifacts and systems; primarily those properties that are open for manipulation to designers, that is, properties that designers can and do intentionally affect by their design decisions (and thus in principle are possible to control). Rather than taking users and their subjective experiences of the artifacts and systems as the primary target for examination, unfashionable as it may be, we have chosen to be objective in the sense of focusing on the artifacts and systems. Apart from discussing our approach, I will briefly introduce some of our main results consisting of some developed definitions of existing (and some new) concepts, such as, interactivity, interactability, interactiveness. I will end with some comments on what this kind of investigation can tell us about the future by introducing the notions of faceless interaction, interactivity clutter, and interactivity fields.\n\nBio: Erik Stolterman is Professor of Informatics and Chair of Informatics at the School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University, Bloomington.

    "abstract": "In this talk I will present the work of the citizen science platform, www.scienceathome.org, which through online games enables ordinary citizens to assist in solving research challenges in fields like quantum physics, chemistry, engineering, psychology, economics, and cognitive science. The games have been played by more than 150,000 people and results from the flagship game, Quantum Moves, have demonstrated that players exhibit superior problem solving abilities compared to state-of-the-art computer algorithms.\n\nA unique feature of online computer games is the fact that they allow us to change the rules of the universe to make the impossible suddenly manageable. In games, players are at first puzzled by the strange rules of the games, but then gradually get accustomed to them and incorporate them into their preexisting intuition. This specially evolved \u00e2\u0080\u009cin-game intuition\u00e2\u0080\u009d can be extremely powerful as a tool for human problem solving. However, it only appears through careful design of the user experience.\n\nWe believe that the mechanism behind the player success is the human ability to rapidly form an intuition for novel challenges and turn this into heuristic strategies. In an interdisciplinary team of physicists, social, cognitive, and computer scientists we study systematically these processes of strategy formation and look for correlations with personal cognitive and physiological traits. The aim is to develop a more complete understanding of the complex processes of human problem solving. This has two potential implications: we learn more about what it means to be human and we might be able to develop novel paradigms of artificial intelligence utilizing smart use of little data rather than pattern recognition in Big Data.\n\nBIO: Jacob is an experimental physicist and founded the ScienceAtHome project to get better performance out of his quantum computer experiment in the basements of Aarhus University. He quickly developed a passion to help allow researchers in all other fields to reap the benefits of the citizen science revolution. ScienceAtHome is a diverse team of scientists, game developers, designers and visual artists based at Aarhus University, Denmark. They create fun scientific games that produce real research results through play.

As most attendees at HCI conferences will agree, a \u00e2\u0080\u009cuser study\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the hallmark of good research in human-computer interaction. But, what is a user study? By and large, a user study is an experiment conforming to the norms for empirical inquiry and the scientific method. It is founded on observation, measurement, and posing and answering testable research questions. Attendees will learn about independent variables, dependent variables, within- and between-subjects conditions, counterbalancing, internal validity, external validity, etc. The course will also include an introduction to the most common statistical tool used for hypothesis testing in HCI: the analysis of variance. No prior experience or statistical knowledge is necessary. An ANOVA tool, written by the presenter in Java, will be provided to attendees through the course\u00e2\u0080\u0099s web site (URL to follow).

Development of game engines, computer power and decreased technological costs have made it possible to use these high fidelity simulators for professional training as a large part of the more proficiency based academic educations. The challenge lay in how to make the most of the simulators when it comes to transforming a novice into a professional.

Guided by pragmatic philosophy and approaches from futures studies, speculative design, the project seeks to demonstrate how interactive objects can be used to engage the audience in creating alternative narratives about the future. In the first section, the paper outlines a narrative in a form of a timeline of events that leads to a future with explicitly restricted privacy in public spaces. Following the timeline of events, the paper describes the process of scenario development, object design, interaction design and audience engagement. The author outlines how engagement through public art and social media allows the interactive object to serve as means of speculation through John Dewey's notion of consummatory experience, allowing both the designer and the audience to act as agents of speculation.  The paper concludes that pragmatic aesthetics and futures studies can provide useful guidance in designing speculative objects and interactions that are open to dialogue and participation.

Their role as pollinators, alongside a myriad of other species, is critical to the continued diets of humankind. This Future Scenario explores a possible near future where human intervention poses new risks to their survival. Drawing on folklore and contemporary beekeeping practices, Mr Shore's Downfall tells a tale of discovery and loss as a young beekeeper is introduced to the world of honey bees. Three imagined artefacts are revealed through the story and discussed with consideration of their cultural context, desirability and relation to socio-economic factors. Themes from Mr Shore's Downfall are examined, and the potential of writing practice for design fiction practitioners is considered.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of design fiction probes', critical narratives to elicit open-ended responses from potential future users of proposed technologies. Inspired and guided by academic literature, such a fictional narrative allows the reader to explore potential consequences of the use of technologies before they actually exist. The method is illustrated by a design fiction on the topic of smart houses and their potential applications for chronic conditions, such as dementia. Based on constant monitoring and automated responses, these technologies have been criticized on ethical grounds. As these devices are not yet widely commercially available, little is known about their real-world impact. By bringing together what is known to write a fictional account from acquisition to end of use, the design fiction can be used both for research or the design process. Potential uses are presented within this paper. ",

As such, we present Symmetry Theory as a useful tool to analyze how an existing design fiction can stimulate reflection, and to plan the writing process of design fiction.",

One of the actions they have taken, is to increase the use of social media in their programmes and shows in order to address their younger audiences. The change, however, has not been straightforward. Social media has been added to the existing broadcasting workflows without examining the possible changes the new media usage would demand. In this paper we use different methods, such as focus group interviews, individual interviews and questionnaires, to obtain opinions and views from broadcasting professionals. Based on these, we discuss on how to improve and rethink the design of the immersive and interactive experience when using social media in TV broadcasting. We are shedding light into the interaction design between broadcaster and viewer, as well as vice versa while using social media. We address questions such as what is the current way of interaction, what are the limits, wishes and opportunities in the future. Our main target is to respond to main improvements and how this can be made commercial and implemented in future live TV.",

Based on findings from field studies, we present a prototype as a first-step towards addressing some of the key needs of these engineers which include improving situation awareness for enhanced remote troubleshooting, integrating all relevant information for easier searching, and faster access to relevant personnel for help.

In this work, we focus on utilizing the 3D accelerometer sensor, available in most of the current mobile devices, as a way to provide an alternative set of gestures to the standard set of multi-touch gestures. We defined these 3D accelerometer-based gestures' definitions based on a user study and built an opens-source library, called 3DA-Gest, for providing the functionality to be used by mobile application developers. Further, we built a proof of concept map-based mobile app to check the working of our library.

    "abstract": "In the last decades, there has been a plethora of research on how to foster public participation. Recently, academia started to experiment with gamification aiming to design participation platforms more engaging as well as attract more citizens. In this paper we analyze the effects of game-inspired elements when applied in public participation applications. In particular, we focus on two types of gamification, namely reward-based gamification and social gamification. Our results suggests that while not everyone perceives gamifying participation as appropriate, social gamification has a greater potential of motivating citizens to become engaged. At the same time, we found no indications that gamification decreases the quality of participation.",

However, the time difference in movement and model fitness were confirmed on a limited scale. The experiment used a 13.3-inch pen tablet, which required primarily wrist movements with a particular level of forearm extension. In this study, we tested the scale effects in the steering time difference between the two tunnel types. In our experiment, participants performed steering operations at five scales, from the entire 21.5-inch tablet area to its 1/12-scale size. The results always showed the time difference, and the conventional steering law did not show a good fit. IDGap improved the fitness, thereby confirming the validity of the model.

They could be used to conveniently interact with an electronic appliance in the environment from a distance. We describe a technique, HeadTurn, that allows a user to look at a device and then control it by turning the head to the left or right. We evaluated HeadTurn using an interface that linked head turning to increasing or decreasing of a number shown on a display. The task was to adjust then number to a given value. We studied the optimal rate at which number should change once the angle of head turn exceed a predefined threshold. We varied the rate of change of the number (217, 290, and 435 ms per change) and the feedback (visual, haptic+visual). In the haptic condition, a 20 millisecond vibration was given through vibrating eye glass frame with each number change. Participants completed number selections faster with shorter intervals but also overshot the target more often. Seven out of 12 participants preferred the middle number changing speed (i.e., 290 ms). There were no statistically significant differences in task completion times. The optimal change rate of the numbers seems to be a compromise between faster selection and overshooting. Haptic feedback made the interaction slightly faster but the difference was not significant. The participants rated their experience with the technique as positive in general.",

    "abstract": "Large interactive wall displays for multi-user interaction are readily available today. However, little is known about the specific aspects influencing usability for applications supporting several users interacting simultaneously and co-located with wall displays. Especially for large screen information applications in public or semi-public places, the ease of noticing and reading text is very important. In this study we are focusing on determining readability in such single-user and multi-user scenarios. Participants in our laboratory study are presented with four different text moving directions in different settings. The evaluation of the results shows that the typical text moving direction (right to left) is not always the optimal choice. When just one user is standing in front of the screen our results showed a preference for a vertical text movement. For reading while walking we found it to be optimal if the text moves with the reader.",

The project aims to protect urban sounds as intangible cultural heritage elements and turn the action of protecting sounds into a collaborative work. Sounds are of great significance in daily urban life and in culture as they carry emotions and awaken cultural memories. Thus, they deserve to be protected and transferred to next generations. In this paper, we first evaluate soundscapes as an intangible cultural heritage element, second we explore the presentation techniques in soundscape studies in the literature, then we explain how the methods implemented step by step, and finally we introduce the two outcomes: the library archive (The Soundscape of Istanbul project) and the crowdsourced web archive (The Soundsslike project). The Soundscape of Istanbul project aims to collect and archive cultural and urban sounds of the city while The Soundsslike project is basically a crowdsourced online sound archive which invites people to record symbolic urban sounds and upload them to the online sound archive. This online platform was built and displayed in an exhibition by means of an interactive tabletop interface to learn more from users and contributors, and to enrich the archive content by raising public awareness of urban sounds.",

The study is based on the premise that displaying relevant information in a team's informative workspace is beneficial, as it readily provides information of common interest. However, existing research shows a lack of experience with software visualization tools in commercial settings. To our current knowledge, there is no study which examines ambient displays in Scrum teams with a longitudinal approach in order to address challenges in awareness and informal communication. A mixed-methods field study, which began in February 2014, is currently being conducted in cooperation with a medium-sized software company near Hamburg, Germany. Our current findings, which the following addresses, support the value of the Ambient Surfaces as a beneficial tool for Scrum teams.",

In this paper, we specifically focus on everyday life reflection, covering and connecting a broad range of topics from someone's life rather than focusing on a very specific aspect.

In this paper, we aim to contribute to this gap through a questionnaire on everyday life reflection practices combining both qualitative and quantitative questions. Findings provide insights in the broad range of people that engage with reflection in different ways.

In this paper, we present initial insights to the design of an interactive mediated sound reality system, which refines the users' interaction with a soundscape. The main contribution of this study is the insights gathered through the use of three observational user experience (UX) methods: (1) note- taking in soundwalks; (2) soundscape visualization; (3) auditory journey maps to overcome the above-mentioned difficulty in rationalizing the intangibility of human- soundscape interaction with focusing, recording and reflecting spatial, temporal and interactive aspects of soundscape.",

Second, the feeling of danger that climbers often experience can be mitigated by trust in the climbing partner and the perception of her active presence. Finally, a big problem in climbing is the communication difficulty between the climbing partners and between climber and instructor.

    "abstract": "Supervisory control of safety-critical systems is usually accomplished by a combination of automation and human authority. Especially in critical situations it is important that the human operator perceives relevant information fast and correctly to ensure safety of the entire system. The abilities of the human perceptual system are limited and thus, Human-Machine Interface (HMI) design should be based on the strengths of human perception. It is crucial to identify how information related to the supervisory control task can be visualized in a way that it can be perceived as fast and as accurate as possible. The current state-of-the-art to design an HMI involves the application of Human Factors (HF) methods to derive the information and the structure necessary for accomplishing the supervisory control task effectively. However, these methods do not offer a systematic approach to further derive an actual visualization that meets human cognitive abilities. This paper presents Konect, a step-by-step method which supports HMI designers to systematically derive psychologically well-founded information visualizations on the basis of well-established HF methods. For a first evaluation of Konect, five HF experts applied the method in a workshop in the automotive domain and approved it. The resulting HMI designs were evaluated against HMIs created by HF experts without Konect in a lab study with 33 participants. Results show that the participants using the Konect HMIs perceived the displayed information significantly faster and more correct than the control group.",

In this paper we inves- tigate the performance of participants exposed to speed de- ception in virtual reality environments controlled by a train- ing bike. With DeceptiBike we created a bike simulator that allows to manipulate speed perception via visual- and hap- tic cues. Our results show that we effectively can increase the users speed by 15.2% without the user noticing the effect.

    "abstract": "Asserting emotions through free-recall is commonly used to evaluate user experience (UX) of interactive systems. From psychology we know that free-recall of emotions leads to a significant memory bias where participants rely on a few of the most intense episodes when asserting an overall experience. It is argued that cued-recall can reduce the memory bias in UX evaluations. Yet, this has not been studied empirically. We present a systematic empirical study based on 38 participants. We measured emotions in terms of objective galvanic skin responses (GSR) and subjective Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) ratings. We found significant correlations between emotions experienced in real-time and those experienced during cued-recall. This validates the use of cued-recall for UX evaluations. An implication is that HCI researchers and practitioners now have cued-recall as an alternative that significantly reduces the memory bias and enables highly detailed measurements of emotions while not disturbing participants during system interaction.",

Another possibility is to leverage capacitive touch inputs of smartphones, tablets and notebooks. However, existing approaches either do not couple physical and virtual representations or require significant post-processing. This paper presents and evaluates a novel approach using a coding scheme for the automatic identification of tangibles by touch inputs when they are touched and shifted. The codes can be generated automatically and integrated into a great variety of existing 3D models from the internet. The resulting models can then be printed completely in one cycle by off-the-shelf 3D printers; post processing is not needed. Besides the identification, the object's position and orientation can be tracked by touch devices. Our evaluation examined multiple variables and showed that the CapCodes can be integrated into existing 3D models and the approach could also be applied to untouched use for larger tangibles.",

Based on the analysis of 1,196 video-taped gestures, 145 atomic gestures could be identified, which in turn were used to create a set of 296 unique gesture combinations. From these, we identified a conflict-free set of 43 gestures to trigger 46 common smartwatch tasks. The results show that symbolic gestures such as drawing a question mark for activating a help function are consistently used across participants. We further found symbolic and continuous gestures to be used significantly more often by men.

In this paper, we investigate this question with the goal of iden- tifying opportunities to equalize contributions between coun- tries. Analyzing the data from StackOverflow and Superuser, two popular Q&A sites, we find that the percentage of con- tributing users significantly varies between 116 countries, and that these differences can be partly explained by a country's national culture and overall English proficiency.

We organized sessions with 34 fortune-tellers and analyzed their verbal and non-verbal interaction during advice instances.

    "abstract": "There has been an interesting development within sustainable HCI, from passive feedback-displays towards more interactive systems that allow users to schedule their energy usage for optimal times based on eco-feedback and eco-forecasting. In this paper, we extend previous work on user scheduling of energy usage in eco-interaction with a study of heat pump control in domestic households. Aiming at using electricity when it is either cheap or green, our approach is to provide users with an interface where they can set temperature boundaries for the home, and interactively evaluate the impact of different settings on predicted energy cost. Based on this input, the scheduling of energy use is done by an automated system monitoring temperatures and electricity prices. We conducted a qualitative study of the HeatDial prototype with 5 families over 6 months. Key findings were that HeatDial supported users identifying and acting on opportunities for reducing costs, but that automation also had an impact on user engagement and highlighted a need for more feedback on how the system intended to act.

A long-term goal of such projects can be seen as providing positive outcomes on local practices. This is, however, a huge challenge. Drawing on the trajectory of the UBI-Oulu project, we identified a variety of stakeholders and abstract forces that shaped the project and its outcomes. The trajectory was largely characterized as reactions to the contesting forces. Our contribution was a framework for making sense, and managing the complexity, of in-the-wild\u00c2\u009d urban computing projects. The framework categorized the implicating factors according to their level of 1) contribution to project goals, 2) interdependence, and 3) foreseeability. The use of the framework could help to relieve the pain in the wild.",

    "abstract": "In everyday life, people regularly make decisions based on uncertain data, e.g., when using a navigation device or looking at the weather forecast. In our work, we compare four representations that communicate different amounts of uncertainty information to the user. We compared them in a study by publishing a web-based game on Facebook. In total, 44 users played 991 turns. We analyzed the turns by logging game metrics such as the gain per turn and included a survey element. The results show that abundance of uncertainty information leads to taking unnecessary risks. However, representations with aggregated detailed uncertainty provide a good trade-off between being understandable by the players and encouraging medium risks with high gains. Absence of uncertainty information reduces the risk taking and leads to more won turns, but with the lowest money gain.",

Specific questions addressed in this paper are whether children express signs of social engagement as a reaction to such events, and if so, in what way. The second question is whether these reactions differ between different types of social events, and finally, whether such reactions disappear or change over time. Our analysis indicates that children indeed show behaviors that indicate social engagement using a range of communicative channels. While gaze towards the robot's face is the most common indication for all types of social events, verbal expressions and nods are especially common for questions, and smiles are most common after positive feedback. Although social responses in general decrease slightly over time, they are still observable after three sessions with the robot.",

Contemporary technologies tend to disengage people from this context and the task the technology performs. This predicament has been referred to as the device paradigm;\u00c2\u009d the resolution to which is in illuminating the technology's context by shaping them as focal things and practices\u00c2\u009d (FT&P).

This becomes difficult due to the partners interwoven digital presence and digital possessions. In this paper, we report on a qualitative study exploring individuals' experiences of relationship break up in a digital context, and discuss their attitudes towards digital possessions from those relationships. Five main themes emerged: digital possessions that sustain relationships, comparing before and after, tainted digital possessions, digital possessions and invasions of privacy, involved and emotional reminiscing.

Previous research in Personal Health Informatics has investigated how people self-manage other chronic conditions, such as diabetes, by tracking and reflecting on their health information but there is little knowledge of how people do so for complex and socially stigmatized diseases like HIV. A better understanding of their specialized needs could lead to the development of more appropriate tools to self-manage their condition. Our paper introduces an iterative process model of Personal Health Informatics. We then describe the results of an empirical study involving HIV+ adults aimed at understanding their issues, concerns and actions in each of the stages of this process model. We provide implications for the design of personal informatics tools and open research directions that can lead to better self-management for people living with HIV.  \\ ",

Some webpages contain mainly text; others exploit flashy ads and a variety of eye-catching pictures. In this paper, we investigate the impact of graphics on webpage aesthetics perception and computation. We split webpages in three categories ( small, moderate and high amount of graphics ) and analyzed how different visual features predicted aesthetics for the different categories. Significant between- category differences were found, e.g., the amount of white space decreased aesthetics for the high-graphic webpages, but not for other webpages; more on-page main colors increased aesthetics for the low-graphic webpages, but decreased for the high-graphic webpages. We suggest future research investigates separately webpages with low and high graphic amount.

    "abstract": "Rendering a 2D node-link representation on a stereoscopic platform supports the idea of having a natural focus+context interaction. In this case, stereoscopic depth can be used to encode the different levels of detail in compound graphs, especially for highlighting the structural relations. We propose an approach that provides a novel interactive operation for expanding or contracting nodes in compound graphs to align these nodes in the 3D space with minimum occlusion, such that the children levels are rendered in a plane closer to the viewer than the parent node. Different visual cues can also be used together to encode other data aspects, e.g., color for encoding node status or shape for encoding node type. The focus of this paper is on a controlled user study that we conducted with 30 participants to evaluate the approach using different configurations. The aim of the study was to understand the viewers' ability of detecting the variation in stereoscopic depth as well as the influence of graph size and the transparency on this ability in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Further, we were interested to measure the participants' acceptance towards our approach of using the stereoscopic depth as a cue for compound graphs. The study results show that stereoscopic depth can be used to encode data aspects of compound graphs under certain circumstances. ",

Three concepts with different levels of system transparency were created to provide Object Recognition (OR) feedback, and subsequently user-tested in a level 3 (NHTSA) Wizard of Oz vehicle. Results indicate that presenting feedback through OR can increase the level of trust in the system, and that users prefer moderation - neither too much nor too little feedback.

In comparison to acoustic based approaches for capturing vibrational signals, IMUs are sensitive to a vast number of factors, both, in terms of the surface and swipe properties, when the interaction is carried out. We contribute by examining the impact of these surface and swipe properties, including surface or bump height and density, surface stability, sensor location, swipe style, and swipe direction.

    "abstract": "This paper describes a process called RAId (Rapid Analysis of design Ideas), which assists, in the ethical and inclusive analysis of large sets of design data.  It is described against an activity with 120 teenagers working in small groups contributing ideas for the design of an interactive water-drinking bottle.  Four investigators systematically examined fifty designs from the teenagers using six different lenses two concerned with the purpose of the designed technology (hydration and re-use), two with its desirability (aesthetics and cool) and two with the product concept (business and innovation). The investigators used these lenses to focus their examination.  Each proposed a candidate solution based on what they had seen from the teen designs.   The resulting concepts are examined against the teenagers' ideas that inspired them with attention being paid to when, and how often, ideas were put in mind. This analysis revealed three different idea types, core, add-ons and novel, each of which needed different treatment to bring it to fruition.",

    "abstract": "With increasingly large smartphones, it becomes more difficult to use these devices one-handed. Due to a large touchscreen, users can not reach across the whole screen using their thumb. In this paper, we investigate approaches to move the screen content in order to increase the reachability during one-handed use of large smartphones. In a first study, we compare three approaches based on back-of-device (BoD) interaction to move the screen content. We compare the most preferred BoD approach with direct touch on the front and Apple's Reachability feature. We show that direct touch enables faster target selection than the other approaches but does not allow to interact with large parts of the screen. While Reachability is faster compared to a BoD screen shift method, only the BoD approach makes the whole front screen accessible.",

    "abstract": "A survey investigated the password behaviors of a sample of 202 men and women from three countries with very different cultures: China, Turkey and the UK.  The survey covered four areas: the context of password use, password creation, password management and attitudes to passwords. A complex pattern of country and gender differences emerged, with most country differences in the context of password use and password creation behaviors, and gender differences in context of password use, password creation and management behaviors. There was little support for three hypotheses concerning cultural differences in password behaviors derived from the dimensions of Power Distance, Individualism-Collectivism, and Uncertainty Avoidance. However, the results suggest that both cultural background and gender need to be taken into account when studying users' password behaviors",

Based on previous work proposing the concept of community artifact ecology as a way of understanding the constellation of technologies a community owns, has access to and uses in their practices, we examine the dynamics and development of such a community artifact ecology in detail. The findings indicate that in volunteer communities developing a working community artifact ecology is a process mixing happenstance, community strategies and everyday tailoring and appropriation tactics. Additionally, much of the design and infrastructuring work in shaping the community artifact ecology and making it work both blurs with use and can be considered as intrinsic design as it is conducted by members of the community, with no input from the outside.  Based on the empirical findings we expand on multiple positions within the theoretical space of design-in-use and intrinsic practice transformation mediated by technology and conclude with a more multi-faceted understanding of the shaping of technology in volunteer-based communities.",

People with dementia develop problems in coping with activities of daily living, including orientation and way-finding tasks. People with moderate to severe dementia are withdrawn and sensitive, which can make caring for and working with them challenging, especially for caregivers. Our work focusses on people with moderate to severe dementia and nursing homes. Building upon previous work in supporting way-finding for people with dementia, we propose an integrated platform to support caregivers and other stakeholders in localizing people and monitoring their whereabouts. Real-time monitoring, a history of location data and heat maps help caregivers to quickly locate people, identify critical situations and learn about preferred locations of residents. Doctors, technology and architectural designers receive valuable data on movement patterns that support diagnosis and intervention planning.",

Multiple views can help people understand different facets of data and data processing, and are a crucial part of data analysis particularly when it is done collaboratively. Both the growing use of multiple views and the increasing display sizes have amplified the need to explore how to better help people to understand the relations between many views. To improve our understanding of how to visualize view relations, we invited visualization and interaction designers to critique and sketch representations of view relations. The participants provided design critiques, and sketched their own relation representations. Our findings expand the range and palette of ways of visually linking visualization views and suggest new directions for designing view relation representations to better support analysis with multiple views.",

Developing autonomous vehicles is technically complex and up to now research has focused on technical improvement and operative safety. As the level of automation increases the role of the driver will change; from controlling every movement of the vehicle into becoming an operator/passenger. Little is known about how this new context will affect the social experiences and socializing. While the social experience and socializing in relation to autonomous vehicles has been overlooked in research and practice, this workshop focus on these aspects. More so, it focuses on three different kinds of social experience and socializing, namely; between other road users and the autonomous car, the social activities within the autonomous car and the relationship between the car and the operator. This workshop addresses these issues and aims at exploring possible practices, research and design directions of autonomous vehicles in relation to social experiences. A human-centred design approach will be the core of the workshop, with playful field excursions and ideation sessions.",

In this workshop, we would like to discuss approaches to research on youth participatory cultures and urban civic life, including digital means of participation and possibly co-creation in such processes.\u00c2\u00a0 Aiming towards a methodology that would guide research in this area, we would like to discuss diverse methods that are presently used in such work, in conjunction with participatory models and forms of cultural and civic engagement and new technologies of participation.",

    "abstract": "Interactive Technology is changing the reading experience and book design fundamentally. While the invention of industry-scale printing changed books into a mass product, interactive technology enables radically new types of engagement during reading. Books can have arbitrary form factors and adjust their visual representation in accordance to the environment and users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs. The aim of this workshop is to explore and exchange ideas on topics emerging in human-computer interaction for book reading experiences. In particular, the aims are to discuss emerging interactive book-related technologies (e.g. Augmented Reality or Tangible Interfaces) and elaborate on various methodologies that can be used to evaluate content. The workshop will investigate how novel technology can inspire, support and enrich the reading experience.",

    "abstract": "A burgeoning topic in the field of user experience (UX) is designing users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 experiences in different channels and touchpoints between an organization and the user. The work so far has largely focused on responsive transmedia design. However, when UX design meets service design, a deeper and broader perspective of the topic emerges: how users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 experiences evolve along the customer journey through different touchpoints. Multi-touchpoint experience design aims to build a harmonious experience journey through the touchpoints. This one-day workshop aims to clarify the terminology in this emerging research area, understand the opportunities and challenges of multi-touchpoint experience design through case studies in different application contexts, identify intriguing research themes, and build a community in this area.",

    "abstract": "During the last decade the public sector has undergone radical changes in the way services are delivered to users. New complex digital platforms have encouraged developers to include users as co-designers. At the same time, decreasing funding has required new ways to address and re-design services. Public service providing organizations, such as libraries and museums, have shown to function well as a place to test and implement re-designed services. Public institutions have also brought to their arenas new types of services, thus acting as a hub or a living lab for new technologies. In this workshop we bring researchers and designers together with public servants and share UX design strategies proven applicable in the public sector. The aim is to encourage new ideas concerning collaboration, competencies, design practices and workflows incorporating public services both in digital and physical space.",

    "abstract": "In this one-day workshop we aim to develop the concept of Pervasive Participation further by reflecting on current forms of advanced e-participation that utilize latest pervasive technologies such as feature-rich smartphones and technically enriched appliances embedded in urban environments. Together we want to brainstorm ideas for effectively leveraging of in-situ participation as well as the combination of mobile and stationary forms of participation. The objective of the workshop is to jointly develop requirements for innovative strategies that engage a broader range of citizens, thus also encouraging less motivated people. The second part of the day will be used for a creative prototyping session that will be fueled with topics from our discussions and presentations.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 As outcome of the workshop we envision guidelines as well as a research roadmap for Pervasive Participation that combines mobile and stationary engagement methods in an engaging way.",
