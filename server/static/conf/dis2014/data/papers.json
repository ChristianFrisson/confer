    "abstract": "Leather is a material used for the making of artifacts ever since early human history, and which can be used also in contemporary design for various types of interactive and electronic products. In this paper, we present a series of small scale explorations of leather, first as skin close interfaces for physical engagement, and secondly in terms of crafting using hand tools and a laser cutter. We reflect on our experiences along these two strands and discuss future possibilities of leather as a rich material for providing new types of interactive experiences. By discussing emerging topics related to traditional crafting processes and contemporary rapid fabrication with this material, we find a great potential of merging such processes and tools for future interaction design settings.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we explore the appropriateness of e-textiles for teaching programming to mixed gender groups ages 8-12, allowing children to construct maker identities around technology. Our findings demonstrate the potential of e-textiles to promote girls\u0090 and boys\u0090 computational literacy, and the required craft and programming skills for making that can disrupt binary gender roles. We argue it allows both girls and boys to demonstrate technical mastery as well as to explore and construct a spectrum of gendered sociotechnical identities that might otherwise be obscured by conventional masculinist attitudes towards technology.",

    "abstract": "Designing and building mechatronic systems has gradually ceased to be the domain of only highly trained professionals and has become broadly accessible. Drawing from a notion of designing as a conversation with the materials of the situation we built an artifact that could actively engage in its own making by embedding a Wizard of Oz operated animated agent into an Arduino prototyping platform. In a 2x2 between-participants Wizard of Oz laboratory experiment with (N=68) high-school students we specifically examined how this prototyping agent\u0090s expression of interest affected perceptions of the agent and learning outcomes dependent on the embodiment of the agent as embedded in the prototyping material itself or as an external entity. We found evidence that embedding an agent into the prototyping material can positively influence learning processes and outcomes while not harming perceptions of the agent.?",

In this paper we present the crafting of, and the reflections on, four prototypes; these prototypes explore how adding new functionality through paper circuits can enrich interactions with paper. We define paper circuits as circuits that have been made through the process of printing or applying conductive ink onto standard paper in order to form electronic or electric circuits. We will provide reflections on not just the benefits of paper circuitry, but also how the newly added affordances gained from paper circuitry effect the experience of paper interactions. This paper will illustrate how this new evolution of paper can be used to produce cheap lightweight ubiquitous electronic products, new art forms, and most importantly enhance the user experience of paper without losing the existing well-loved affordances that paper currently possesses.",

    "abstract": "Video chat programs for home and personal use (e.g., Skype) are becoming increasingly popular for doing more than simply conversing with a remote friend or family member. This creates a need to understand the broader use of video chat that moves \u00d0beyond talking heads.\u00d3 In this paper, we investigate one emergent scenario: major life events where video chat is used to connect remote participants to a ritual gathering (e.g., a wedding, a funeral). To explore this scenario, we conducted an online survey with 87 people who reported on their usage of video chat for viewing or sharing major life events. Our results show that major life events, as an example of a burgeoning set of video chat scenarios, bring unique socio-technical contexts and challenges. Asymmetry characterized much of the findings: we find differences between local and remote group sizes, environments, atmosphere, and emotionality. We discuss these situations and identify ways to improve the design of video chat to better support shared experiences.",

Three families lived with the system for a month, as an exploration of how tokens might be used as resources for practical action.

However, while all families saw the potential for shared use, only one used it this way in earnest.

We found that our participants received, discovered, and made use of many small traces held by artifacts, people, and building materials. Those traces were used to provide practical assistance to participants\u0090 appropriation of their houses as well as to connect participants with the past in an evocative manner. Our analysis highlights the roles played by the social context and the mutability of the house in the experience of remembering the house as well as in shaping participants\u0090 attitudes of passing on traces of prior appropriation of the place. To illustrate the design implications of those findings, we offer three design concepts to characterize potential ways of using traces captured by ubicomp environments in the long term.",

To counter this opinion, we aim to foster engagement with and curiosity about STEM subjects, through an approach to learning that facilitates the construction of understanding of key, threshold concepts (TCs). To achieve this, we engender creativity by using performance as a means of expression. We demonstrate how the process of collaboratively crafting a video to explain a TC students have been introduced to helps them to break down the concept, and through reflection on each piece of knowledge about it, build understanding about its different aspects, and further develop their knowledge. We aim through this approach to encourage students to work together to discover, explore, engage in lateral, visual thinking, and therefore develop deep, shared understanding of TCs in STEM subjects.",

To help organize and investigate this literature, this paper present a review of research on systems designed to support reflection. Key findings include that most work in this area does not actually define the concept of reflection. We also find that most evaluations do not focus on reflection per se rather but on some other outcome arguably linked to reflection. Our review also describes the relationship between reflection and persuasion evidenced implicitly by both rhetorical motivations for and implementation details of system design. After discussing the significance of our findings, we conclude with a series of recommendations for improving research on and design for reflection.",

Through a user-centered design process we explored interaction techniques for transparent-display mobiles and classified them into four categories: overlay, dual display & input, surface capture and model-based interactions. We investigated the technical feasibility of such interactions by designing and building two touch-enabled semi-transparent tablets called tPads and a range of tPad applications. Further, a user study shows that tPad interactions applied to everyday mobile tasks (application switching and image capture) outperform current mobile interactions and were preferred by users. Our hands-on design process and experimental evaluation demonstrate that transparent displays provide valuable interaction opportunities for mobile devices.?",

The study is based on six similar-sized, shape-changing artifacts that combine simple sensing of users with actuation that change volume, texture, and orientation. Our results show that the 18 respondents distinguish artifacts on dimensions that differ from those of most models of shape change. For instance, they characterize shape-change in terms of personality, territoriality, and state of mind, in addition to more common categories such as appearance and product properties.

Such concept of communicating a result prior to taking an action is known as feedforward [6]. Feedforward is an important element to be considered in the user interface design as it provides clear and instant affordance of what will occur before the next action.

It supports fluid transitions between informal sketches and formal computer-based representations. We asked 12 composers to use Polyphony to compose an electronic accompaniment to a 20-second instrumental composition by Anton Webern. All successfully created a complete, original composition in an hour and found the task challenging but fun. The resulting dozen comparable snapshots of the composition process reveal how composers both adapt and appropriate tools in their own way.",

Much past research has addressed technical problems such as latency to create simulacra of co-present performance settings. In contrast, we draw on the literature on digitally mediated performance in HCI to get a richer context for understanding networked live musical events. We describe a system, MESHWORKS, which permits the definition of varied participation roles and unusual network topologies, and explore its use to realize ArCCADE _ a project to create events that support multiple overlapping musical ensembles and invite curiosity-driven exploration by the audience. Our experience with the system, the events and the interfaces we built to support engagement are discussed. In particular, we document how a musical community has emerged around our research and discuss wider implications for how we conceive the cultural meshwork new performance technologies are implicated in.",

    "abstract": "Computer visions (CV) systems are increasingly finding new roles in domains such as healthcare. These collaborative settings are a new challenge for CV systems, requiring the design of appropriate interaction paradigms. The provision of feedback, particularly of what the CV system can \u00d0see,\u00d3 is a key aspect, and may not always be possible to present visually. We explore the design space for audio feedback for a scenario of interest, the clinical assessment of Multiple Sclerosis using a CV system. We then present a mixed-methods experimental study aimed at providing some first insights into the challenges and opportunities of designing audio feedback of this kind. Specifically, we compare audio feedback that differentiates which body parts the CV system can see to audio feedback that is undifferentiated. The findings reveal that it is not enough to simply convey that something might be out of view of the camera as what the camera can \u00d0see\u00d3 depends on the specific configuration of participants and the peculiarities of the skeleton inference algorithms. The results highlight the importance of providing feedback which more naturally conveys spatial information in developing CV systems for collaborative use.",

We begin with an ethnographic study of two resident storytellers at the District Six Museum, Cape Town, Noor Ebrahim and Joe Schaffers, who tell audience their personal Apartheid-era narratives. An analysis of their narratives and audience interactions led to the design a digital storytelling prototype in the form of a virtual environment containing two storyteller agents based on Joe and Noor. These agents simulated two interactions: questions in which users could ask the storyteller agents questions; and exchange structures where storyteller agents ask users questions. We evaluated the effectiveness of these in a controlled experiment (n = 101) and found that questions led to significant increases in narrative engagement (p=0.05) and interest (p=0.02) while exchange structures significantly improved narrative enjoyment (p=0.004), engagement (p=0.002) and interest (p=0.02).",

However, due to the limitation of current methodologies and human memory, research participants might recall specific prior use episodes and less their experience over time. In this note, we examine how to encourage retrospection and reflection concerning the changes of use experience in the past and over time. We have reviewed relevant research and traced the usage of temporal references in those studies, such as diagrams of use measurement over time or the history of interactive products. We propose the notion of temporal anchors as way of capturing and grounding temporal aspects of long-term use experience. We have found that methods that include temporal anchors have facilitated opportunities for rich reflections and communications around use experience and temporality.",

In this paper, we present a framework of design principles that could be used to design humorous products. First, we identified three aspects of experience with humorous products by collecting various amusing products and analyzing them with designers. Next, we conducted a workshop with professional comedians and designers to understand methods for creating humorous products. Through this process, we elicited nine principles for making products humorous: visualization of taboo, bizarre consequence, destructive play, zoomorphism, self-depreciation, abused product, shape incongruity, unconventional use, and unexpected function. To understand how the principles are used in the conceptual design phase, we conducted design sessions for a water fountain using a software application to explain the principles. The results indicate that some principles were more actively used. This work contributes to knowledge on designing products and interaction that deliver more positive feelings to users.",

Two studies of the device at work demonstrated how crafting was an expression of intimacy when the device was used to connect the workplace to the home, and a way of demonstrating skill and humor to a broad audience when messages were sent amongst co-workers. However, the level of skill needed to produce these messages became a barrier to entry for some co-workers. Our findings suggest that visible ownership of a situated device, which can be personalized in other ways, can underpin a secondary level of participation that is crucial in supporting a sense of involvement when the level of crafting required can stifle more direct participation.",

Patients can lose interest because of passive motion from limited stimulation. To understand the effects of multisensory manipulation and to reflect patients\u0090 motivation during therapy, we introduce the novel Shape-changing Robot (SR) that can alter its surface in response to users\u0090 movements, including visuo-tactile stimulus. The proposed SR was evaluated through an experiment with five post-stroke patients. This study shows that the SR\u0090s physical movement can entice patients into a physical and emotional engagement by capturing their attention through physical motion, rather than through virtual motion. Furthermore, the SR can induce communicative gestures. This gesture pattern might help stroke patients become motivated to practice movement in therapy.",

It concerns designing for the complex persuasive situation of helping parents of hospitalized children take better care of themselves. Our focus was on the experiences, on how these were designed to be persuasive, and on the design process needed to achieve that. We conclude that designing for complex persuasive experiences requires a design approach that allows for designers to gradually develop a rich understanding of the situation and develop empathy for the people they design for. We found that the persuasion should focus on a combination of starting a new practice, sustaining it, starting activities within the practice, and extending the duration of the activities. For such a complex persuasive situation a rich palette of experiences was needed. The design of those experiences was inspired by universal human needs and by gaining a deep and empathetic understanding of the situation.",

How can we explain and teach how criticality can be applied to design? How can we assess, compare and give context to critical designs? How should we understand the relationships among practices that bear affinities to critical design, such as speculative design or critical engineering? We argue that many of these issues would be clarified if the HCI and design research communities had a collection of examples that exemplified not just critical design in general, but also its major genres, styles, historical trends, rhetorics, and other distinctions. As a first step in this direction, we detail our efforts to develop a more systematic vocabulary to talk about critical design. After assembling a small operative corpus from a wider inventory of critical designs, we apply poststructuralist semiotic theory to propose a number of analytic distinctions and concepts that could be used\u008balong with others like them\u008bto more systematically and deliberately construct a canon of exemplars and a more mature conceptual vocabulary for critical design.",

Increasingly, however, people have begun to identify themselves as both, neither, other, or dynamic gender, rejecting cleanly separated Male/Female duality. In this project, student designers used critical design to explore how the descriptive infrastructure of a database might foreground, instead of restrict, the \u00d0residual\u00d3\u008ba term that encapsulates the ambiguity and plurality masked by simple category structures like Male/Female.

    "abstract": "Transparent displays can serve as an important collaborative medium supporting face-to-face interactions over a shared visual work surface. Such displays enhance workspace awareness: when a person is working on one side of a transparent display, the person on the other side can see the other\u0090s body, hand gestures, gaze and what he or she is actually manipulating on the shared screen. Even so, we argue that designing such transparent displays must go beyond current offerings if it is to support collaboration. First, both sides of the display must accept interactive input, preferably by at least touch and / or pen, as that affords the ability for either person to directly interact with the workspace items. Second, and more controversially, both sides of the display must be able to present different content, albeit selectively. Third (and related to the second point), because screen contents and lighting can partially obscure what can be seen through the surface, the display should visually enhance the actions of the person on the other side to better support workspace awareness.

We collected observations and 48 interviews with 12 undergraduate design students who used a computer supported group critique system over 5 critique sessions, analyzed using grounded theory. We found that: (a) the write-first script helped overcome initial learning costs; (b) the interactive critique features created a dual-channel critique that increased the number of critiquers, duration of critique and interactivity; and (c) the system produced a greater volume of useful critique and promoted reciprocity among critiquers. The study provides improved principles for developing computer supported novice group critique systems in design.",

    "abstract": "We present findings from a qualitative study with 28 participants of the dyadic intercultural communication tensions professionals experience in Face-to-Face (FTF) and Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) workplace interactions. We identify four categories of intercultural communication tensions that emerged most frequently in our dataset including range of emotional expression, level of formality, \u00d0fixed\u00d3 versus flexible appointments and task versus social-orientation. We discuss how these tensions manifested in FTF and CMC media and unravel the ways media supports or hinders intercultural communication. We present the adaptations participants made to mitigate such tensions and offer implications for design. Our findings demonstrate that the most frequently occurring intercultural communication tensions manifested in both FTF and CMC, regardless of the medium used. This indicates that cultural communication challenges will persist no matter the medium, highlighting the opportunity for technologies to better support workplace intercultural communication.",

We define the design space as a conceptual space, which in addition to being co-constituted, explored and developed by the designer encompasses the creativity constraints governing the design process. While design spaces can be highly complex, our constraint-based understanding enables us to argue for the benefits of a systematic approach to mapping and manipulating aspects of the design space. We discuss how designers by means of a simple representation, a design space schema, can identify the properties of the prospective product that s/he can form. Through a case study, we show how design space schemas can support designers in various ways, including gaining an overview of the design process, documenting it, reflecting on it, and developing design concepts. Finally, we discuss the potentials and limitations of this approach.",

This paper explores the synthesis process and opportunities for providing computational support. First, we present interviews with novice and expert designers on the common practices and challenges of syn-thesis. Based on these interviews, we developed digital whiteboard software support for sorting individual segments of user research. The system separates out individual and group activity and helps the team externalize and synthesize their different views of the data. Through a case study, we explore two computer-supported approaches: a structured condition that externalizes the different perspectives on the data of each team member and an unstructured condition that allows each member to organize data into clusters. Novice designers tended to prefer the structured synthesis process, while more experienced designers preferred to freely arrange information segments and create clusters on their own.

Within Ubicomp, proxemic interaction researchers argue that people have a similar social understanding of their spatial relations with nearby digital devices, which can be exploited to better facilitate seamless and natural interactions. To do so, both people and devices are tracked to determine their spatial relationships. While interest in proxemic interactions has increased over the last few years, it also has a dark side: knowledge of proxemics may (and likely will) be easily exploited to the detriment of the user. In this paper, we offer a critical perspective on proxemic interactions in the form of dark patterns: ways proxemic interactions can be misused. We discuss a series of these patterns and describe how they apply to these types of interactions. In addition, we identify several root problems that underlie these patterns and discuss potential solutions that could lower their harmfulness.",

Such systems enable the wearer to use their body as an input and output platform with interactive graphics. Projects such as PALMbit and Skinput sought to answer the initial and fundamental question: whether or not on-body interfaces were technologically possible. Although considerable technical work remains, we believe it is important to begin shifting the question away from how and what, and towards where, and ultimately why. These are the class of questions that inform the design of next generation systems. To better understand and explore this expansive space, we employed a mixed-methods research process involving more than two thousand individuals. This started with high-resolution, but low-detail crowdsourced data. We then combined this with rich, expert interviews, exploring aspects ranging from aesthetics to kinesthetics.

We extend Heidegger\u0090s concept of present-at-hand with a new concept of present-at-body, defined as the reflective use of tools for developing bodily self-awareness.

Observation and/or interviews of 19 radiologists revealed that stack scrolling dominated the resulting task examples. We iteratively crafted and obtained radiologist feedback for a variety of prototypes, then evaluated their scrolling and annotation-review support for lay users. With a simplified stack seeded with correct / incorrect annotations, we compared the effect of four scrolling techniques (traditional scrollwheel and click-and-drag, plus sliding-touch, and tilt rate control) and visual vs. haptic annotation cues on scrolling dynamics, detection accuracy and subjective factors. Scrollwheel was fastest overall, and combined visual / haptic annotation cues sped target-finding relative to either modality alone.

Typically, design studies for affect assume either that it is possible for computers to objectively identify users\u0090 emotions, or that emotion is completely subjective and thus rely solely on human interpretation. By drawing on the feminist concept of performativity, we explain how to conceive of computational representations and human actors as co-constructing emotions. Through a case study of Freaky, a system that uses such models of emotion to sup-port human interpretation, we demonstrate how machine learning models of affect can be constructed and incorporated in systems designed for open-ended user interpretation of affect. Qualitative results from a user deployment show that a performative approach to modeling emotion is possible. We thus demonstrate the potential of performative theories to be generative of new computational and design practices that support hybrid human-machine enactments of emotion.",

    "abstract": "Taking it\u0090s origin from the notion of the cargo cult as an elaborate misunderstanding, this paper suggests a series of exploratory design methods to support users in generating requirements and scenarios-of-use for technological objects that do not yet exist. Strategies from fields such as art and performance are used to create experiences of user-involvement centered on the making of non-functional mock-ups. These can then act as props through which the participant can express their intuitions and concerns with a given technological notion. The processes described makes use of a broad range of cultural drivers to engage users in playful misunderstandings that facilitate new, out of the ordinary, interpretations of objects. The paper outlines the basis of three projects, discuss the drivers behind each project and suggests guidelines for creating these kinds of exploratory embodied experiences.",

    "abstract": "In the age of mobile communications and social media, users are connected to interact with other people, and often obliged to be socially active as technology drives to connect us. In this paper, we harness the technology for the opposite use: helping people to avoid company instead of encouraging interaction. We have developed the concept of an asocial hiking application (app), in which users can generate routes that avoid meeting other people. We developed the concept based on user feedback data derived from an online survey (n=157) and two focus groups, and created a tool that generates solitary hiking routes based on OpenStreetMap data and additional information from the web. In addition, to make the application react to dynamic changes in the environment, we developed a mobile application prototype that scans Wi-Fi signals to detect other hikers nearby and warn of their approach. The prototype was tested and evaluated with 8 hikers in-the-wild. In addition to the concept design and the functional prototype, we present findings on people\u0090s, especially hikers, need for solitude, and introduce user feedback from each stage of the prototype design process as well as design recommendations for an asocial navigation application.",

This approach considers the climatic patterns, weather conditions and people\u0090s adaptations to them on the level of everyday practices. Our theoretical and methodological foundations lay in the fields of cultural anthropology, architecture, and HCI. First, we present a multidisciplinary discussion of prior works relating to technology, weather and climate conditions. Secondly, through two empirical, mostly qualitative data sets, we demonstrate the vast impact weather and climate have on young adults\u0090 ICT use at our research site located in Northern Finland. Thirdly, based on the theoretical discussion and findings from the real-world studies, we argue that climate sensitive thinking should be part of the design of urban ICT, and outline some central design challenges.",

However, most existing tools for sharing biometric data lock researchers into vendor-specific solutions that cannot be easily adapted to the specific researchers\u0090 requirements, users\u0090 needs and ethical considerations. To mitigate this, we investigate the requirements for open source researcher-oriented biometric data sharing systems. Requirements were captured using: first-hand insights from two prototype deployments, a systematic review of the literature, and interviews with HCI researchers who have built such tools. The requirements thus captured were implemented in the BioShare system and insights from implementing these requirements are presented. BioShare allows users both to share data but also receive inputs from remote viewers of the data in real-time. Concurrently it provides logging capabilities for researchers to analyze system interactions.?",

We then define a cut as a subset of collected data with some shared feature, develop a set of cuts over location and physical activity data, and visualize those cuts using a variety of presentations. Finally, we conduct a month long field deployment with participants tracking their location and physical activity data and then using our methods to examine their data.

We found that Tango Cards enabled a variety of uses that made design knowledge about tangible learning games accessible to designers.

Our analysis shows that our approach has important benefits, such as the ability to identify undesired input, provide words of high semantic relevance, as well as a broader scope of keywords.

By making the restricted body an integral part of gameplay, we hope to, as a side product of gameplay, bring about the best and also most safe body posture for young players/children travelling by car, i.e., sitting reasonably upright and still in their child seat with their head leaning back on the neck rest. Another outcome of this could also be an overall safer situation in the car, in that children not sitting still in their child seats while being driven might be stressful for the driver. By presenting the details of our design efforts in this particular design context, we hope to add also to the knowledge we, in HCI, have for how to design bodily experiences with technology at large.",

    "abstract": "Over the last years, digital fabrication technologies such as 3D printers have become more and more common at universities and small businesses as well as in communities of hobbyist makers. The high complexity of such technologies, the rapid technological progress and the close link between hardware and software in this field poses challenges for users and communities learning how to operate these machines, especially in the contexts of existing (and changing) practices. We present an empirical study on the appropriation of 3D printers in two different communities and derive design implications and challenges for building appropriation infrastructures to help users face those challenges and making technologies more sociable.",

This paper makes two contributions: (1) drawing from a two year ethnographic study of trad musicians, it details the design and development of a system to track and publish traditional musicians\u0090 practices while respecting the ethos of tradition, and (2) it presents a discussion of professional musicians\u0090 reactions to having their music practices surveilled.

    "abstract": "As we come to live, work and play in an increasingly digital society, the future of interactive systems research, design, and practice will be shaped partly by larger-scale, cyber-physical systems. The cyber-physical LIT KIT enhances children\u0090s picturebook reading, both during and after interactive read-alouds, creating a multi-media, mixed-reality experience that transforms everyday environments into an environment evocative of the picturebook being read. The room-filled audio-visual-spatial effects of the LIT KIT contextualize language and provide feedback to the participants. The LIT KIT also acts as a story-extension tool, allowing children to customize environmental effects towards interpreting picturebooks for themselves. This paper offers a scenario of the child-computer interaction afforded by the LIT KIT, elucidates the motivations for its design, and focuses on an evaluation activity and its results. Particularly for DIS researchers in the educational domain, the LIT KIT represents a design exemplar that supports children\u0090s enjoyment of learning and meaning-making.",

We motivate these online methods through a survey of 27 design instructors, who identified common challenges of conducting student-user interactions in physical settings, including coordination constraints and geographical barriers to meeting in person. We then describe our research through design to create and test 10 activities in a classroom setting, including using Twitter for needfinding and using Reddit to brainstorm ideas with experts. Finally, we present an emergent framework outlining the design space for crowd-based design activities where students learn to use input from online crowds to inform their design work.

The results show that a system\u0090s usefulness is shaped by the context in which it is used, usability is closely linked to usefulness, usefulness may have both pragmatic and hedonic attributes, and usefulness is critical in defining users\u0090 overall evaluation of a system (i.e., its goodness).

Perhaps for this reason, little work has been conducted to investigate how designers\u0090 personal experiences can contribute to technology design. Yet it\u0090s undeniable designers have applied their personal experiences to their design practice and also benefited from such experiences.

In order to improve parallel usage and dissolve crowds, our wide display subtly directs individual users by visual stimuli and manipulates the audience like a puppeteer, thus reversing the notion of adaptive content being implicitly manipulated by the users. We first investigated visual signifiers which attract initial users approaching sideways, and then others, which actively influence user positions and regulate audience constellations. We found that dynamic visual stimuli such as frames and ellipses are effective (1) to direct users in front of the display, (2) to distribute multiple users along the display, (3) static frames are more effective than moving or interactive ones, and (4) these visual stimuli also work indirectly by inducing social pressure among users.",

Designing for interaction with media fa\u008dades has traditionally posed challenges regarding proxemics, scale of the augmented architecture and placement of interactive spaces. With the increasing availability and affordability of interactive technologies, factors such as playability and tangibility are assumed not only to be present but also to enable richer collective experiences. We propose a new approach for interaction with large media fa\u008dades employing embodied audio-visual interaction at the floor level. That way, the floor level serves as proxy for interacting with the media fa\u008dade whilst facilitating social encounters. We discuss aspects considered during different phases of the project development and derive principles for connecting zones of proxemics, promoting encounters by distributing the performance, designing for urban activation and isolating implementation concerns.",

It is becoming ever more commonplace to see discussions and examples of digital memorials in research literature, technology shows and art galleries. However, the design space for digital memorials has, to date, been little explored. In this paper, we propose an emergent framework for digital memorials, based around notions of actors, inputs, form and message. The framework is grounded in examples of current memorialization practice, and situated within a contextual understanding of memorials as an emergent digital phenomenon within a networked society. In detailing the framework we highlight features of the design space that can be exploited in the development of bespoke memorial technologies, and identify potential areas of future interest that this framework brings to the fore, such as HCI\u0090s engagement with critical concepts of the postself and temporality.",

This process is inherently subjective, both as a curated collection of the elements of one\u0090s life, and as an evolving form of remembrance that is subject to the interpretations of those to whom it is left. Based on directed storytelling sessions with 14 adults from a large Midwestern city in the United States, we explore users\u0090 perceptions of how their use of digital systems and information will impact how their lives are interpreted and reflected upon by their families and by future generations. Our findings describe nuances regarding how shifting notions about technological systems and the long-term accessibility of digital information impact the ways in which we share, and subsequently manage, information online. This work, explored here in the context of legacy, exposes opportunities to help users engage with their digital information through the curation of meaningful records, the dispossession of digital debris, and a reexamination of how digital systems and services influence the accessibility and lifespan of digital information.",

Each day, the system takes one picture from a user\u0090s smartphone album, prints it on thermal paper as a halftone image, and deletes it from the smartphone. With a critical lens, we reframe technology-mediated reminiscence as an intersubjective interaction between human and artifact. In this mutually informed relationship, we propose perceived drawbacks as a design quality for provoking the critical sensibilities of users and engaging them in transgressing the normality of digital photo consumption.

We review the qualities of the piano as an input device, observing four design opportunities: 1) chords, 2) redundancy (more keys than letters in English), 3) the transfer of musical skill and 4) optional sound feedback. Although some have been utilized in previous text entry methods, our goal is to exploit all four in a single design. We present PianoText, a computationally designed mapping that assigns letter sequences of English to frequent note transitions of music. It allows fast text entry on any MIDI-enabled keyboard and was evaluated in two transcription typing studies. Both show an achievable rate of over 80 words per minute. This parallels the rates of expert Qwerty typists and doubles that of a previous piano-based design from the 19th century. We also design PianoText-Mini, which allows for comparable performance in a portable form factor. Informed by the studies, we estimate the upper bound of typing performance, draw implications to other text entry methods, and critically discuss outstanding design challenges.?",

    "abstract": "With designers increasingly moving beyond button pushing and flat-screen interaction towards tangible and embodied interaction, techniques for user studies need to develop as well. While ethnographic video studies and ethnomethodological analyses are becoming standard in many interaction design projects, it remains a challenge to investigate in detail how people interact with all of their body. Analysis of full-body movement is time consuming, notation techniques are rare, and findings are difficult to share between members of a design team. In this paper we propose tangible video analysis, a method developed to engage people from different backgrounds in collaboratively analyzing videos with the help of physical objects. We will present one of these tools, Action Scrabble, for analyzing temporal organization of human actions. We work with a case of skilled forklift truck driving. By backtracking our design research experiments, we will unfold how and why the tangible tool succeeds in engaging designers with varied analysis experience to collaboratively focus on human action structures _ and even find video analysis fun!",

    "abstract": "The 'Uncanny Valley' theory explains the counter-intuitive phenomenon where people may get suddenly uncomfortable with an artificial entity when it becomes very similar to humans. We propose the existence of an \u00d0uncanny valley\u00d3 for embodied interaction, when a user\u0090s body motions in the physical space (the locus of interaction) are incompletely mapped into effects in the virtual space (the focus of interaction). It is generally assumed that this mapping should be as veridical as possible to promote seamless embodied interaction. Many design factors (e.g., synchronicity, sensitivity, shared realism) contribute to veridical locus-focus mapping. We intentionally varied the level of veridicality of these different factors, affecting how the user\u0090s movements were mapped to virtual effects. Our results indicate that there is a dip (valley) in user preferences when the design contains mixed degrees of veridicality. Thus, when one veridical dimension is limited, designers should likewise reduce the veridicality of other dimensions.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the use of interactive sound feedback for dance pedagogy based on the practice of vocalizing while moving. Our goal is to allow dancers to access a greater range of expressive movement qualities through vocalization. We propose a methodology for the sonification of Effort Factors, as defined in Laban Movement Analysis, based on vocalizations performed by movement experts. Based on the experiential outcomes of an exploratory workshop, we propose a set of design guidelines that can be applied to interactive sonification systems for learning to perform Laban Effort Factors in a dance pedagogy context.",
