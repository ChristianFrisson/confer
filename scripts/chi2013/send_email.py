Dear %s,

Hope you enjoyed using myCHI at CHI 2013! To help you access and share your favorite papers, we have added two new features:

1. We have added ACM links to each paper so that you can easily download your favorite papers.
2. We have added BibTeX export for your favorite papers so you can easily reference them and share them with others.

We would love to hear from you about your experience with myCHI this year. Please share your comments and suggestions by completing this short survey:
